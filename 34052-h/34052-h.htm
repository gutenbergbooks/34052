<h3>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION</h3>

  <p>Although during the last few years very little, in common with other
  wireless work, has been possible in connection with the practical side of
  the wireless transmission of photographs, yet, now that the prospect of
  experimental work is once again occupying the minds of all wireless
  workers, advantage has been taken of a reprint of this little volume to
  amplify a few points that were insufficiently dealt with in the first
  edition, and also to add some fresh matter.</p>

  <p>To Chapter V. has been added a short description of the Nernst lamp,
  and also some useful information regarding photographic films, and a few
  notes relating to enlarging included in the Appendix B.</p>

  <p>A fresh appendix dealing with the principles of optical lenses has
  also been added. This is a subject that plays an important part in any
  system of wireless photography, and to those experimenters whose
  knowledge of optics is limited this section should prove useful.</p>

  <p>To serious workers engaged on the problem of the wireless transmission
  of photographs, attention <!-- Page vi --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pagevi"></a>{vi}</span>is called to a series of articles which are
  being published from time to time in the <i>Wireless World</i>, on the
  design and construction of wireless photographic apparatus.</p>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>

  <p>In these progressive times it is only reasonable to expect that some
  attempt would be made to utilise the ether-waves for other purposes than
  that of telegraphic communication, and already many clever minds are at
  work trying to solve the problems of the wireless control of torpedoes
  and airships, wireless telephony, and, last but not least, the wireless
  transmission of photographs.</p>

  <p>It may seem rather premature to talk about the wireless transmission
  of photographs at a time when the ordinary systems are not fully
  developed; but the prospects of wireless photography are of a very
  encouraging nature, especially for long over-water distances, as there
  are great difficulties to be overcome in long-distance transmission over
  ordinary land lines and cables which will be entirely eliminated by
  wireless methods.</p>

  <p>From a perusal of Chapter I. the reader will be able to understand
  something of the difficulties that are to be encountered in working over
  long distances, and he will also be able to appreciate something of the
  advantages that would be derived <!-- Page viii --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="pageviii"></a>{viii}</span>from a reliable
  wireless system. Apart from the value of such a system for transmitting
  news pictures, it would also be of great advantage to transmit to ships
  at sea photographs of criminals for identification purposes. In such a
  small volume as this it would be impossible to deal with the working of
  wireless apparatus and the many systems that have been devised for the
  transmission of photographs over metallic circuits. The Author has taken
  it for granted that other works have been studied in connection with
  these subjects, and will therefore only describe such apparatus as is
  likely to be of use in wireless transmission. At present the transmission
  of photographs by wireless methods is in a purely experimental stage, and
  this book will have served its purpose if it helps to put future
  experimenters on the right track and prevent them from making expensive
  and fruitless experiments, by showing them the right direction in which
  investigations are being carried out. As there is no claim to originality
  in respect of a good many pieces of apparatus, etc., described, I have
  not thought it necessary to state the various sources from which the
  information has been obtained.</p>

<h3>RADIO-PHOTOGRAPHY</h3>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p class="cenhead">INTRODUCTORY</p>

  <p>Those who desire to experiment on radio-photography, <i>i.e.</i>
  transmitting photographs, drawings, etc., from one place to another
  without the aid of artificial conductors, must cultivate at least an
  elementary knowledge of optics, chemistry, mechanics, and electricity;
  photo-telegraphy calling for a knowledge of all these sciences. There
  are, no doubt, many wireless workers who are interested in this subject,
  but who are deterred from experimenting owing to a lack of knowledge
  regarding the direction developments are taking, besides which,
  information on this subject is very difficult to obtain, the science of
  photo-telegraphy being, at the present time, in a purely experimental
  stage.</p>

  <p>The wireless transmission of photographs has, no doubt, a great
  commercial value, but for any system to be commercially practicable, it
  must be simple, rapid, and reliable, besides being able to work <!-- Page
  2 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>{2}</span>in conjunction
  with the apparatus already installed for the purpose of ordinary wireless
  telegraphy.</p>

  <p>As far back as 1847 experiments were carried out with a view to
  solving the problem of transmitting pictures and writing by electrical
  methods over artificial conductors, but no great incentive was held forth
  for development owing to lack of possible application; but owing to the
  great public demand for illustrated newspapers that has recently sprung
  into being, a large field has been opened up. During the last ten years,
  however, development has been very rapid, and some excellent results are
  now being obtained over a considerable length of line.</p>

  <p>The wireless transmission of photographs is, on the other hand, of
  quite recent growth, the first practicable attempt being made by Mr. Hans
  Knudsen in 1908. It may seem rather premature to talk about the wireless
  transmission at a time when the systems for transmitting over ordinary
  conductors are not perfectly developed, but everything points to the fact
  that for long-distance transmission a reliable wireless system will prove
  to be both cheaper and quicker than transmission over ordinary land lines
  and cables.</p>

  <p>The effects of capacity and inductance&mdash;properties inherent to
  all telegraph systems using metallic conductors&mdash;have a distinct
  bearing upon the two questions, how far and how quickly can <!-- Page 3
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>{3}</span>photographs be
  transmitted? Owing to the small currents received and to prevent
  interference from earth currents it is necessary to use a complete
  metallic circuit. If an overhead line could be employed no difficulty
  would be experienced in working a distance of over 1000 miles, but a line
  of this length is impossible&mdash;at least in this country&mdash;and if
  transmission is attempted with any other country, a certain amount of
  submarine cable is essential. It has been found that the electrostatic
  capacity of one mile of submarine cable is equal to the capacity of 20
  miles of overhead line, and as the effect of capacity is to retard the
  current and reduce the speed of working, it is evident that where there
  is any great length of cable in the circuit the distance of possible
  transmission is enormously reduced.</p>

  <p>If we take for an example the London-Paris telephone line with a
  length of 311 miles and a capacity of 10.62 microfarads, we find that
  about half this capacity, or 5.9 microfarads,<a name="NtA1"
  href="#Nt1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> is contributed by the 23 miles of cable
  connecting England with France.</p>

  <p>In practice the reduction of speed due to capacity has, to a great
  extent, been overcome by means of apparatus known as a line-balancer,
  which hastens the slow discharge of the line and <!-- Page 4 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>{4}</span>allows each current sent
  out from the transmitter&mdash;the current in several systems being
  intermittent&mdash;to be recorded separately on the receiver. Photographs
  suitable for press work can now be sent over a line which includes only a
  short length of cable for a distance of quite 400 miles in about ten
  minutes, the time, of course, depending upon the size of the photograph.
  In extending the working to other countries where there is need for a
  great length of cable, as between England and Ireland, or America, the
  retardation due to capacity is very great. On a cable joining this
  country with America the current is retarded four-tenths of a second. In
  submarine telegraphy use is made of only one cable with an earth return,
  but special means have had to be adopted to overcome interference from
  earth currents, as the enormous cost prohibits the laying of a second
  cable to provide a complete metallic circuit. The current available at
  the cable ends for receiving is very small, being only
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>200000</sub>th part of an ampere, and this necessitates
  the use of apparatus of a very sensitive character. One system of
  photo-telegraphy in use at the present time, employs what is known as an
  electrolytic receiver (see Chapter III.) which can record signals over a
  length of line in which the capacity effects are very slight, with the
  marvellous speed of 12,000 a minute, but this speed rapidly decreases
  with an increase of distance between the <!-- Page 5 --><span

  /></a><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 1.</span> two stations. The effect of
  capacity upon an intermittent current is clearly shown in Fig. 1. If we
  were to send twenty brief currents in rapid succession over a line of
  moderate capacity in a given time, we should find that instead of being
  recorded separately and distinctly as at <i>a</i>, each mark would be
  pointed at both ends and joined together as shown at <i>b</i>, while only
  perhaps fifteen could be recorded. If the capacity be still farther
  increased as at <i>c</i>, only perhaps half the original number of
  currents could be recorded in the same time, owing to the fact that with
  an increase of resistance, capacity, and inductance of the line a longer
  time is required for it to charge up and discharge, thereby materially
  lessening the rate at which it will allow separate signals to pass; the
  number of signals that can therefore be recorded in a given time is
  greatly diminished. If we were to attempt to send the same number of
  signals over a line of great capacity, as could be sent, and recorded
  separately and distinctly over a line of small capacity&mdash;the time
  limit being of course the same in both instances&mdash;we should find
  that the <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page6"></a>{6}</span>signals would be recorded practically as a
  continuous line. The two latter cases <i>b</i>, and <i>c</i>, Fig. 1,
  clearly shows the retardation that takes place at the commencement of a
  current and the prolongation that takes place at the finish. If the
  photo-telegraphic system previously mentioned could be rendered sensitive
  enough to work on the Atlantic cables, we should find that only about
  1200 signals a minute could be recorded, and this would mean that a
  photograph which could be transmitted over ordinary land lines in about
  ten minutes would take at least fifty minutes over the cable. This would
  be both costly and impracticable, and time alone will show whether, for
  long-distance work, transmission by wireless will be both cheaper and
  more rapid than any other method. At present wireless telegraphy has not
  superseded the ordinary methods of communicating over land, but there can
  be no doubt that wireless telegraphy, if free from Government
  restrictions, would in certain circumstances very quickly supersede
  land-line telegraphy, while it has proved a formidable commercial
  competitor to the cable as a means of connecting this country with
  America. Likewise we cannot say that no system of radio-photography will
  ever come into general use, but where there is any great distance to be
  bridged, especially over water, wireless transmission is really the only
  practical solution. From the <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page7"></a>{7}</span>foregoing remarks, it is evident that a
  reliable system of radio-photography would secure a great victory in the
  matter of time and cost alone, besides which, the photo-telegraphic
  apparatus would be merely an accessory to the already existing wireless
  installation.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:40%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig02.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig02.png"

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 2.
  </div>

  <p>There have been numerous suggestions put forward for the wireless
  transmission of photographs, but they are all more or less impracticable.
  One of the earliest systems was devised by de' Bernochi of Turin, but his
  system can only be regarded interesting from an historical point of view,
  and as in all probability it could only have been made to work over a
  distance of a few hundred yards it is of no practical value. Fig. 2 will
  help to explain the apparatus. A glass cylinder A' is fastened at one end
  to a threaded steel shaft, which runs in two bearings, one bearing having
  an internal thread corresponding with that on the <!-- Page 8 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>{8}</span>shaft. Round the cylinder
  is wrapped a transparent film upon which a photograph has been taken and
  developed. Light from a powerful electric lamp L, is focussed by means of
  the lens, N, to a point upon the photographic film. As the cylinder is
  revolved by means of a suitable motor, it travels upwards simultaneously
  by reason of the threaded shaft and bearing, so that the spot of light
  traces a complete spiral over the surface of the film. The light, on
  passing through the film (the transmission of which varies in intensity
  according to the density of that portion of the photograph through which
  it is passing), is refracted by the prism P on to the selenium cell S
  which is in series with a battery B and the primary X of a form of
  induction coil. As light of different intensities falls upon the selenium
  cell,<a name="NtA2" href="#Nt2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> the resistance of
  which alters in proportion, current is induced in the secondary Y of the
  coil and influences the light of an arc lamp of whose circuit it is
  shunted. This arc lamp T is placed at the focus of a parabolic reflector
  R, from which the light is reflected in a parallel beam to the receiving
  station.</p>

  <p>The receiver consists of a similar reflector R' with a selenium cell E
  placed at its focus, whose resistance is altered by the varying light
  falling upon it from the reflector R. The selenium cell <!-- Page 9
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>{9}</span>E is in series
  with a battery F and the mirror galvanometer H. Light falls from a lamp D
  and is reflected by the mirror of the galvanometer on to a graduated
  aperture J and focussed by means of the aplanatic lens U upon the
  receiving drum A<sup>2</sup>, which carries a sensitised photographic
  film. The two cylinders must be revolved synchronously. The above
  apparatus is very clever, but cannot be made to work over a distance of
  more than 200 yards.</p>

  <p>A system based on more practical lines was that invented and
  demonstrated by Mr. Hans Knudsen, but the apparatus which he employed for
  receiving has been discarded in wireless work, as it is not suitable for
  working with the highly-tuned systems in use at the present time.</p>

  <p>Knudsen's transmitter, a diagrammatic representation of which is given
  in Fig. 3, consists of a flat table to which a horizontal to-and-fro
  motion is given by means of a clockwork motor. Upon this table is
  fastened a photographic plate which has been prepared in the following
  manner. The plate upon which the photograph is to be taken has the
  gelatine film from three to four times thicker than that commonly used in
  photography. In the camera, between the lens and this plate, a single
  line screen is interposed, which has the effect of breaking the picture
  up into parallel lines. Upon the plate being developed and before it is
  <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page10"></a>{10}</span><span class="figright" style="width:43%;"><a
  href="images/illo-fig03.png"><img style="width:100%"
  src="images/illo-fig03.png" alt="Fig.3." title="Fig.3." /></a><span
  class="sc">Fig.</span> 3.</span> completely dry, it is sprinkled over
  with fine iron dust. With this type of plate the transparent parts dry
  much quicker than the shaded or dark parts, and on the iron dust being
  sprinkled over the plate it adheres to the darker portions of the film to
  a greater extent than it does to the lighter portions; a picture partly
  composed of iron dust is thus obtained. A steel point attached to a flat
  spring rests upon this plate and is made to travel at right angles to the
  motion of the table. As the picture is partly composed of iron dust, and
  as the steel needle is fastened to a delicate spring it is evident that
  as the plate passes to and fro under the needle, both the spring and
  needle are set in a state of vibration. This vibrating spring makes <!--
  Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>{11}</span>and
  breaks the battery circuit of a spark coil, which in turn sets up
  sparking in the spark-gap of the wireless apparatus.</p>

  <p>The receiver consists of a similar table to that used for
  transmitting, and carries a glass plate that has been smoked upon one
  side. A similar spring and needle is placed over this plate, but is
  actuated by means of a small electro-magnet in circuit with a battery and
  a sensitive coherer. As the coherer makes and breaks the battery circuit
  by means of the intermittent waves sent out from the transmitting aerial,
  the needle is made to vibrate upon the smoked glass plate in unison with
  the needle at the transmitting end. Scratches are made upon the smoked
  plate, and these reproduce the picture on the original plate. A print can
  be taken from this scratched plate in a similar manner to an ordinary
  photographic negative.</p>

  <p>The two tables are synchronised in the following manner. Every time
  the transmitting table is about to start its forward stroke a powerful
  spark is produced at the spark-gap. The waves set up by this spark
  operate an ordinary metal filings coherer at the receiving end which
  completes the circuit of an electro-magnet. The armature of this magnet
  on being attracted immediately releases the motor used for driving,
  allowing it to operate the table. The time taken to transmit a
  photograph, quarter-plate size, is about fifteen minutes. <!-- Page 12
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"></a>{12}</span>Although very
  ingenious this system would not be practicable, as besides speed the
  quality of the received pictures is a great factor, especially where they
  are required for reproduction purposes. The results from the above
  apparatus are said to be very crude, as with the method used to prepare
  the photographs no very small detail could be transmitted.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p class="cenhead">TRANSMITTING APPARATUS</p>

  <p>Let us now consider the requirements necessary for transmitting
  photographs by means of the wireless apparatus in use at the present
  time.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:24%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig04.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig04.png"
      alt="Fig. 4." title="Fig. 4." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 4.
  </div>

  <p>The connections for an experimental syntonic wireless transmitting
  station are shown in the diagram Fig. 4. A is the aerial; T, the
  inductance; E, earth; L, hot-wire ammeter. The closed oscillatory circuit
  consists of an inductance F, spark-gap G, and a block condenser C. H is a
  spark-coil for supplying the energy, the secondary J being connected to
  the spark-gap. A <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page14"></a>{14}</span>mercury break N and a battery B are placed
  in the primary circuit of the coil. The Morse key K is for completing the
  battery circuit for signalling purposes. When the key K is depressed, the
  battery circuit is completed, and a spark passes between the balls of the
  spark-gap G producing oscillations in the closed circuit, which are
  transposed to the aerial circuit by induction. For signalling purposes it
  is only necessary for the operator by means of the key K to send out a
  long or short train of waves in some pre-arranged order, to enable the
  operator at the receiving station to understand the message that is being
  transmitted.</p>

  <p>If a photograph could be prepared in such a manner that it would serve
  the purpose of the key K, and could so arrange matters that a minute
  portion of the photograph could be transmitted separately but in
  succession, and that each portion of the photograph having the same
  density could be given the same signal, then it would only be necessary
  to have apparatus at the receiving station capable of arranging the
  signals in proper sequence (each signal recorded being the same size and
  having the same density as the transmitted portion of the photograph) in
  order to receive a facsimile of the picture transmitted.</p>

  <p>The following method of preparing the photograph<a name="NtA3"
  href="#Nt3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> is one that has been adopted in several
  <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page15"></a>{15}</span>systems of photo-telegraphy, and is the only
  one at all suitable for wireless transmission. The photograph or picture
  which is to be transmitted is fastened out perfectly flat upon a
  copying-board. A strong light is placed on either side of this copying
  board, and is concentrated upon the picture by means of reflectors. The
  camera which is used for copying has a single line screen interposed
  between the lens and sensitised plate, and the effect of this screen is
  to break the picture up into parallel lines. Thus a white portion of the
  photograph would consist of very narrow lines wide apart, while the dark
  portion would be made up of wide lines close together; a black part would
  appear solid and show no lines at all. From this line negative it will be
  necessary to take off a print upon a specially prepared sheet of metal.
  This consists of a sheet of thick lead- or tinfoil, coated upon one side
  with a thin film of glue to which bichromate of potash has been added;
  the bichromate possessing the property of rendering the glue waterproof
  when acted upon by light. The print can be taken off by artificial light
  (arc lamps being generally used), but the exact time to allow for
  printing can only be found by experiment, as it varies considerably
  according to the thickness of the film. The printing finished, the metal
  print is washed under running water, when all those parts not acted upon
  by light, <i>i.e.</i> the parts between the lines, are <!-- Page 16
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>{16}</span>washed away,
  leaving the bare metal. We have now an image composed of numerous bands
  of insulating material (each band varying in width according to the
  density of the photograph at any point from which it is prepared)
  attached to a metal base, so that each band of insulating material is
  separated by a band of conducting material. It is, of course, obvious
  that the lines on the print cannot be wider apart, centre to centre, than
  the lines of the screen used in preparing it. A good screen to use is one
  having 50 lines to the inch, but one is perhaps more suitable for
  experimental work a little coarser, say 35 lines to the inch. To use a
  screen having 50 or more lines to the inch, the transmitting apparatus,
  as will be evident later on, will require to be very nearly perfect.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:23%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig05.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig05.png"
      alt="Fig. 5." title="Fig. 5." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 5.
  </div>

  <p>Before proceeding further it will perhaps be as well to make an
  experiment. If we take one of the metal prints or, more simple, draw a
  sketch in insulating ink upon a sheet of metal A, Fig. 5, and connect a
  battery B and the galvanometer D as shown, we shall find on drawing the
  free end of the wire across the metal plate that all the time the wire is
  in contact with the lines of insulating material the needle of the
  galvanometer will remain <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>{17}</span>at zero, but where it is in contact with the
  metal plate the needle is deflected.</p>

  <p>From this experiment it will be seen that we have in our metal line
  print, which consists of alternate lines of insulating and conducting
  material, a method by which an electric circuit can be very easily made
  and broken. It is, of course, necessary to have some arrangement whereby
  the whole of the surface of the metal print is utilised for this purpose
  to the best advantage. One type of transmitting machine used for this
  purpose is represented by the diagram, Fig. 6. The cylinder A is fastened
  to the steel shaft B, which runs in the two bearings D and D', the
  bearing D' having an internal thread corresponding to that on the shaft.
  The stylus in this class of machine is a fixture, the cylinder being
  given a lateral as well as a revolving movement. As it is impossible to
  use a rigid drive, a flexible coupling F is employed between the shaft B
  and the motor.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:31%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig06.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig06.png"
      alt="Fig. 6." title="Fig. 6." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 6.
  </div>

  <p>Another type of machine is shown in Fig. 7. The drum in this case is
  stationary, the table T moving laterally by reason of the screwed shaft
  <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page18"></a>{18}</span><span class="figright" style="width:22%;"><a
  href="images/illo-fig07.png"><img style="width:100%"
  src="images/illo-fig07.png" alt="Fig. 7." title="Fig. 7." /></a><span
  class="sc">Fig.</span> 7.</span> and half nut F. The table, shown
  separate in Fig. 8, carries a stiff brass spring A, to which is attached
  a holder B made to take a hardened steel point. The holder is provided
  with a set screw P for securing the steel point Z. The spring and needle
  are insulated from the rest of the machine, as shown in the drawing. In
  working, the metal print is wrapped tightly round the cylinder of the
  machine, the glue image being, of course, uppermost. To fasten the print
  a little seccotine should be applied to one edge, and the joint carefully
  smoothed down with the fingers. <span class="figleft"
  style="width:27%;"><a href="images/illo-fig08.png"><img
  style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig08.png" alt="Fig. 8." title="Fig. 8."
  /></a><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 8.</span> If there is any tendency on
  the part of the print to slip round on the drum, a couple of small spring
  clips placed over the ends of the drum will act as a preventive. It is
  necessary to place the print upon the drum in such a manner that the
  stylus draws away from the edge of the lap and not towards it, and the
  metal prints should be of such a size that when placed round the drum of
  the <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page19"></a>{19}</span>machine a lap of about
  <sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch is allowed.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:24%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig09.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig09.png"
      alt="Fig. 9." title="Fig. 9." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 9.
  </div>

  <p>The steel point Z (ordinary gramophone needles may be used and will be
  found to answer the purpose admirably) is made to press lightly upon the
  metal print, and while the pressure should be sufficient to make good
  electrical contact, it should not be sufficient to cause the needle to
  scratch the surface of the foil. The pressure is regulated by means of
  the milled nut H. The electrical connections are given in Fig. 9. One
  wire from the battery M is taken to the terminal T, and the other wires
  from M and F lead to the relay R. The current flows from the battery M
  through the spring Y, through the drum and metal print, the stylus Z,
  spring A, down to the relay R, and from R back to the battery M. As the
  drum carrying the single line half-tone print is revolved, the stylus, by
  reason of the lateral movement given to the table or cylinder as the case
  may be, will trace a spiral path over the entire surface of the print. As
  the stylus traces over a conducting strip the circuit is completed, and
  the tongue of the relay R is attracted, making contact with the stop S.
  <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>{20}</span>On
  passing over a strip of insulation the circuit is broken and the tongue
  of the relay R returns to its normal position.</p>

  <p>As already stated, the conducting and insulating bands on the print
  vary in width according to the density of the photograph from which it is
  prepared, so that the length of time that the tongue of the relay R is
  held against the stop S, is in proportion to the width of the conducting
  strip which is passing under the stylus at any instant. The function of
  the transmitter is therefore to send to the relay R an intermittent
  current of varying duration.</p>

  <p>The two photographs Figs. 10 and 10<i>a</i> are of a machine designed
  and used by the writer in his experiments. In this machine the drum is
  3.5 inches long and 1.5 inches in diameter. The lead screw has 30 threads
  to the inch, and the reduction between it and the drum is 3:1, so that
  the table has a movement of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>90</sub>th inch per
  revolution of the drum.</p>

  <p>From the brief description of the various types of machines that have
  been given it will be apparent that in the design of the machine proper
  there is nothing very complicated, although the addition of the driving
  and synchronising apparatus complicates matters rather considerably. The
  questions of driving and synchronising the machines at the two stations
  is fully dealt with in Chapter IV.</p>

    by a cross screen.
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>{21}</span></p>

  <p>Although the design of the machines is rather simple great attention
  must be paid both to accuracy of construction and accuracy of working,
  and this applies, not only to the machines (whether for transmitting or
  receiving) but for all the various pieces of apparatus that are used. Too
  much care cannot be bestowed upon this point, as in the wireless
  transmission of photographs there is a large number of instruments all
  requiring careful adjustment, and which have to work together in perfect
  unison at a high speed.</p>

  <p>The machine shown in Figs. 10 and 10<i>a</i> was designed and used by
  the writer solely for experimental work. It will be noticed in the
  description given in the appendix of the method of preparing the metal
  prints that a 5" × 4" camera is recommended, while the machine, Fig. 10,
  is designed to take a print procured from a quarter-plate negative. This
  size of drum was adopted for several reasons, and although it will be
  found quite large enough for general experimental work the writer has
  come to the conclusion that for practical commercial work a drum to take
  a print 5" × 4" will give better results.</p>

  <p>In making a negative of a picture that is required for reproduction
  purposes, the line screen in the camera is replaced by a "cross screen,"
  <i>i.e.</i> two single line screens placed with their lines at an angle
  of 90° to one another, and this breaks the <!-- Page 22 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>{22}</span>image up into small
  squares instead of lines. By looking at any ordinary newspaper or book
  illustration through a powerful magnifying glass the effects of a cross
  screen will readily be seen. With a cross screen a certain amount of
  detail is necessarily lost, but with a single line screen the amount lost
  is much greater. If there is any very small detail in the picture most of
  this would be lost in a coarse screen, hence the necessity of employing
  as fine a line screen as practicable in order to get as much detail in as
  possible. It is mainly on this account that a 5" × 4" print is
  recommended, as, if fairly bold subjects are used for copying, the small
  detail (this is, of course, a very vague and indefinable term) will not
  be too fine, and the time required for transmitting reasonable. For
  obvious reasons it is a great advantage to put the print under pressure
  to cause the glue image to sink into the soft metal base and leave a
  perfectly flat and smooth surface. It is essential that the bands on the
  print lie along the axis of the cylinder, so that the stylus traces its
  path across them, and not with them.</p>

  <p>We have now an arrangement that is capable of taking the place of the
  key K, Fig. 4, and the diagram, Fig. 11, gives the connections for the
  complete transmitter. A is the aerial, E earth, T inductance, L ammeter.
  The closed oscillatory circuit consists of a spark-gap G, inductance F,
  <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page23"></a>{23}</span><span class="figright" style="width:38%;"><a
  href="images/illo-fig11.png"><img style="width:100%"
  src="images/illo-fig11.png" alt="Fig. 11." title="Fig. 11." /></a><span
  class="sc">Fig.</span> 11.</span> and a condenser C. The secondary J of
  the coil H is connected to the spark-gap, and the primary P is in circuit
  with the mercury break N, the battery B, and the local contacts of the
  relay R. The action is as follows. When contact is made between the
  stylus Z and the drum V by means of the conducting bands on the line
  print, the circuit of the relay R and the battery M is completed. The
  closing of the local circuit of the relay R actuates the second relay R',
  allowing the primary circuit of the coil H to be closed. As soon as the
  primary circuit of the coil is completed sparks pass between the
  electrodes of the spark-gap G, causing waves to radiate from the aerial.
  The duration of the wave-trains radiated depends upon the duration of
  contact made by the relays <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page24"></a>{24}</span>R and R', and this in turn depends upon the
  width of the conducting strip that is passing under the stylus. The
  battery M should be about 4 volts, and the battery D about 2 volts. The
  two-way switch X is connected up so that the relay R' can be thrown out
  and the key K switched in for ordinary signalling purposes. If any
  sparking takes place at the point of the stylus, a small condenser C'
  (about 1 microfarad capacity) should be connected as shown. In the
  present instance the condenser should be used more as a preventive than
  as a cure, as in all probability the voltage from M will not be
  sufficient to cause destructive (if any) sparking; but, as most wireless
  workers know, anything in the nature of a spark occurring in the
  neighbourhood of a detector (this, of course, only applies when the
  receiving apparatus is placed in close proximity to the transmitter) is
  liable to destroy the adjustment.</p>

  <p>In transmitting over ordinary conductors where the initial voltage is
  fairly high and the self-induction of the circuit very great, the use of
  the condenser will be found to be absolutely essential. It has also been
  noted that the angle which the stylus presents to the drum has a marked
  effect upon the sparking, an angle of about 60° being found to give very
  good results.</p>

  <p>If the size of the single line print used is 5 inches by 4 inches, and
  a screen having 50 lines <!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page25"></a>{25}</span>to the inch is used for preparing it, then
  the stylus will have to make 250 contacts during one revolution of the
  drum. Assuming the drum to make one revolution in three seconds, then the
  time taken to transmit the complete photograph can be found from the
  equation T = <i>w</i> × <i>t</i> × <i>s</i>, where <i>w</i> is the width
  of the print, <i>t</i> the travel of the stylus during one revolution of
  the drum, and <i>s</i> the time required for one revolution of the drum.
  In the present instance this will be T = 4 × 90 × 3 = 1080 seconds = 18
  minutes. The number of contacts made by the stylus per minute is 5000,
  and in working at this speed the first difficulty is encountered in the
  use of the two relays. The relay R is lightly built, and capable of
  working at a fairly high speed, but R' is a heavier pattern, and
  consequently works at a slightly lower rate. This relay must necessarily
  be heavier, as more substantial contacts are needed in order to pass the
  heavy current taken by the spark-coil.</p>

  <p>Relays sensitive and accurate enough to work at this speed will in all
  probability be beyond the reach of the majority of workers, but there are
  several types of relays on the market very reasonable in price that will
  answer very well for experimental work, although the speed of working
  will no doubt be slower.</p>

  <p>For the best results the duration of the wave-trains sent out should
  be of the same duration as <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>{26}</span>the contact made by R, and therefore equal
  to the time taken by the stylus to trace over a conducting strip; but if
  the duration of the contact made by R is <i>t</i>, then that made by R'
  and consequently the duration of the groups of wave-trains would be
  <i>t</i> - <i>v</i> where <i>v</i> equals the extra time required by R'
  to complete its local circuit. The difference in time made by the two
  relays, although very slight, will be found to affect very considerably
  the quality of the received pictures. Renewing the platinum contacts is
  also a great expense, as they are soon burnt out where a heavy current is
  passed. If the distance experimented over is short so that the power
  required to operate the spark-coil is not very heavy, one relay will be
  sufficient providing the contacts are massive enough to carry the current
  safely. It is useless to expect any of the ordinary relays in general use
  to work satisfactorily at such a high speed, and in order to compensate
  for this we must either increase the time of transmitting, or, as already
  suggested, make use of a coarser line screen in preparing the
  photographs.</p>

  <p>For reasons already explained, all points of make and break should be
  shunted by a condenser. The effective working speed of an ordinary type
  of relay may be anything from 1000 to 2500 dots a minute, depending upon
  accuracy of design and construction.</p>

  <p>In the wireless transmission of photographs it <!-- Page 27 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>{27}</span>is absolutely essential
  to use some form of rotary spark-gap, as where sparks are passed in rapid
  succession the ordinary type of gap is worse than useless. When a spark
  passes between the electrodes of an ordinary spark-gap, Fig. 12, we find
  that for a fraction of a second after the first spark has passed, the
  normally high resistance of the gap has been lowered to less than one
  ohm. If the column of hot gas which constitutes the spark is not
  instantly dispersed, but remains between the electrodes, it will provide
  an easy path for any further discharges, and if sparks are passed at all
  rapidly, what was at first a disruptive and oscillatory discharge will
  degenerate into a hot, non-oscillatory arc.<a name="NtA4"
  href="#Nt4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Two forms of rotating spark-gaps are shown in Figs. 13 and 14, and are
  known as "synchronous" and "non-synchronous" gaps respectively. In the
  synchronous gap the cog-wheel is mounted on the shaft of the alternator,
  and a cog comes opposite the fixed electrode when the maximum of
  potential is reached in the condenser, thus ensuring a discharge at every
  alternation of current. With this type of gap a spark of pure tone is
  obtained which <!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page28"></a>{28}</span><span class="figleft" style="width:31%;"><a

  /></a><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 14.</span> is of great value where the
  signals are received by means of a telephone, but where the signals are
  to be mechanically recorded the tone of the spark is of little
  consequence. In a non-synchronous gap a separate motor is used for
  driving the toothed wheel, and can either be mounted on the motor shaft
  or driven by means of a band, there being no regard given to synchronism
  with the alternator. The fixed electrode is best made long enough to
  cover about two of the teeth, as this ensures regular sparking and a
  uniform sparking distance; the <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page29"></a>{29}</span>spark length is double the length of the
  spark-gap. The toothed wheel should revolve at a high speed, anything
  from 5000 to 8000 revolutions per minute, or even more being required.
  The shaft of the toothed wheel is preferably mounted in
  ball-bearings.</p>

  <p>Owing to the large number of sparks that are required per minute in
  order to transmit a photograph at even an ordinary speed, it is necessary
  that the contact breaker be capable of working at a very high speed
  indeed. The best break to use is what is known as a "mercury jet"
  interrupter, the frequency of the interruptions being in some cases as
  high as 70,000 per second. No description of these breaks will be given,
  as the working of them is generally well understood.</p>

  <p>In some cases an alternator is used in place of the battery B, Fig. 4,
  and when this is done the break M can be dispensed with. In larger
  stations the coil H is replaced with a special transformer.</p>

  <p>The writer has designed an improved relay which will respond to
  currents lasting only <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub>th part of a second, and
  capable of dealing with rather large currents in the local circuit.<a
  name="NtA5" href="#Nt5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> This relay has not yet been
  tried, but if it is successful the two relays R and R' can be dispensed
  with, and the result will be more accurate and effective
  transmission.</p>

  <p>The connections for a complete experimental station, transmitting and
  receiving apparatus combined, are given in Fig. 15. The terminals W, W
  are for connecting to the photo-telegraphic receiving apparatus Q, being
  a double pole two-way switch for throwing either the transmitting or
  receiving apparatus in circuit. There is another system of transmitting
  devised by Professor Korn, which employs an entirely different method
  from the foregoing. By using the apparatus just described, the waves
  generated are what are known as "damped waves," and by using these damped
  waves, tuning, which is so essential to good commercial working, can be
  made to reach a fairly high degree of efficiency. <!-- Page 31 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>{31}</span></p>

  <p>The question of damped <i>versus</i> undamped waves is a somewhat
  burning one, and no attempt will be made here to deal with the merits or
  demerits of the claims made for the respective systems. A series of
  articles describing the production of undamped waves and their efficiency
  in working compared with damped waves will be found in the <i>Wireless
  World</i>, Nos. 3 and 4, 1913, and are well worth reading by any one
  interested in the subject.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 16.
  </div>

  <p>A diagrammatic representation of the apparatus as arranged by
  Professor Korn is given in Fig. 16. The undamped or "continuous" waves
  are generated by means of a high-frequency alternator or Poulsen arc. In
  Fig. 16, X is the generator, F inductance, C condenser; the aerial
  inductance T is connected by the aerial A and earth E. By this means the
  waves are tuned to a certain period. <!-- Page 32 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>{32}</span>A metal print, similar to
  what has already been described, is wrapped round the drum D of the
  machine, and when the stylus Z traces over an insulating strip the waves
  generated are in tune with the receiving station, but when it traces over
  a conducting strip, a portion of the inductance T is short-circuited, the
  period of the oscillations is altered, and the two stations are thrown
  out of tune.</p>

  <p>The receiving station is provided with an aperiodic circuit, which
  consists of an inductance F', condenser C', and a thermodetector N. A
  string galvanometer H (described in Chapter III.), and the self-induction
  coils B, B' are connected as shown, the coils B, B' preventing the
  high-frequency currents, which change their direction, from flowing
  through the galvanometer. The manner in which the string galvanometer is
  arranged to reproduce a transmitted picture is shown in Fig. 24.</p>

  <p>The connections adopted by the Poulsen Company for photographically
  recording wireless messages are given in Fig. 17, a string galvanometer
  of the Einthoven type being used. The two self-induction coils S and S'
  are in circuit with the detector D and the galvanometer G. The condenser
  C' prevents the continuous current produced by the detector from flowing
  through the high frequency circuit; P is the primary of the aerial <!--
  Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page33"></a>{33}</span>inductance and F the secondary. The method
  of transmitting adopted by Professor Korn appears to be a simple and
  reliable arrangement, provided that an equally reliable method of
  producing the undamped waves can be found. Owing to the absence of
  mechanical inertia it should be capable of working at a good speed, while
  the absence of a number of pieces of delicate apparatus all requiring
  careful adjustment add greatly to its reliability.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 17.
  </div>

  <p>In any spark system with a properly designed aerial a coil taking ten
  amperes is capable of transmitting signals over a distance of thirty to
  fifty miles, but where the number of interruptions of the break required
  per second is very high, as in radio-photography, it must be remembered
  that a much higher voltage is needed to drive the requisite amount of
  current through the primary winding of the coil than would be the case if
  the interruptions were slower. It is possible to use platinum <!-- Page
  34 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>{34}</span>contacts for
  the relays, for currents up to ten amperes, but for heavier currents than
  this some arrangement where contact is made with mercury will be found to
  be more economical and reliable.</p>

  <p>In the transmitter already described and given in Fig. 11, the best
  results would be obtained by finding the speed at which the relay R'
  works best, and regulating the number of contacts made by the stylus
  accordingly.</p>

  <p>The method employed by De' Bernochi (see Chapter I.) of varying the
  intensity of a beam of light by passing it through a photographic film,
  which in turn alters the resistance of a selenium cell, has been very
  successfully employed in at least one system of photo-telegraphy. Its
  application has also been suggested for wireless transmission, and
  although with any system using continuous waves this would not be very
  difficult, it could hardly be adapted to work with the ordinary spark
  system. The apparatus for receiving from this type of transmitter would,
  on the other hand, necessarily be more elaborate than the methods that
  are described in the next chapter, and as far as the writer's experience
  goes, experiments along these lines would not prove very profitable, as
  simplicity is the keynote of success in any radio-photographic
  system.</p>

  <p>It has been suggested that in order to decrease the time of
  transmission a cylinder capable of <!-- Page 35 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>{35}</span>taking a print 7 inches
  by 5 inches be employed, the print being prepared from rather a coarse
  line screen&mdash;say 35 to the inch&mdash;and a traverse of about
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub> inch given to the stylus, thus reducing the
  time of transmission to about twelve minutes. It is questionable,
  however, whether the increase in speed would compensate for the loss of
  detail, as only very bold subjects could be transmitted. As already
  pointed out, wireless transmission would only be employed for fairly long
  distances, and the extra time and expense required to receive a fairly
  good detailed picture is negligible when compared with the enormous time
  it would take to receive the original photograph by any ordinary means of
  transit.</p>

  <p>The public much prefer to have passable pictorial illustrations of
  current events than wait several days for a more perfect
  picture&mdash;the original, and the advantage of any newspaper being able
  to publish photographs several days before its rivals is obvious. There
  can also be no doubt but that a system of radio-photography, if fairly
  reliable and capable of working over a distance of say thirty miles,
  would be of great military use for transmitting maps and written matter
  with a great saving of time and even life. Written matter could be
  transmitted with even greater safety than messages which are sent in the
  ordinary way in Morse Code, as the signals received in the receiver <!--
  Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>{36}</span>of an
  hostile installation would be but a meaningless jumble of sounds, and
  even were they possessed of radio-photographic apparatus the received
  message would be unintelligible, unless they knew the exact speed at
  which the machines were running and could synchronise accurately.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p class="cenhead">RECEIVING APPARATUS</p>

  <p>There are only two methods available at present for receiving the
  photographs, and both have been used in ordinary photo-telegraphic work
  with great success. They have disadvantages when applied to wireless
  work, however, but these will no doubt be overcome with future
  improvements. The two methods are (1) by means of an ordinary
  photographic process, and (2) by means of an electrolytic receiver.</p>

  <p>In several photo-telegraphic systems the machine used for transmitting
  has the cylinder twice the size of the receiving cylinder, thus making
  the area of the received picture one-quarter the area of the picture
  transmitted. The extra quality of the received picture does not
  compensate for the disadvantage of having to provide two machines at each
  station, and in the writer's opinion results, quite good enough for all
  practical purposes, can be obtained by using a moderate size cylinder so
  that one machine answers for both transmitting <!-- Page 38 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span>and receiving, and using
  as fine a line screen as possible for preparing the photographs.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:30%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig18.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig18.png"
      alt="Fig. 18." title="Fig. 18." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 18.
  </div>

  <p>The writer, when first experimenting in photo-telegraphy, endeavoured
  to make the receiving apparatus "self-contained," and one idea which was
  worked out is given in Fig. 18. The electric lamp L is about 8 c.p., and
  is placed just within the focus of a lens which has a focal length of
  <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch. When a source of light is placed at some
  point between a lens and its principal focus, the light rays are not
  converged, but are transmitted in a parallel beam the same size as the
  lens. It has been found that this arrangement gives a sharper line on the
  drum than would be the case were the light focussed direct upon the hole
  in the cone A. An enlarged drawing of the cone is given in Fig. 19. The
  hole in the tip of the cone A is a bare <sup>1</sup>/<sub>90</sub> inch
  in diameter&mdash;the size of this hole depends upon the travel per
  revolution of the drum or table of the machine used&mdash;and in working,
  the cone is run as close as possible to the <!-- Page 39 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>{39}</span>drum without being in
  actual contact. The magnet M is wound full with No. 40 S.C.C. wire, and
  the armature is made as light as possible. The spring to which the
  armature is attached should be of such a length that its natural period
  of vibration is equal to the number of contacts made by the transmitting
  stylus. The spring must be stiff enough to bring the armature back with a
  fairly crisp movement. The spring and armature is shown separate in Fig.
  20.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:23%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 20.
  </div>

  <p>The shutter C is about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch square and made
  from thin aluminium. The hole in the centre is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub>
  × <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch, and the movement of the armature is
  limited to about <sup>3</sup>/<sub>32</sub> inch. In all arrangements of
  this kind there is a tendency for the armature spring to vibrate, as it
  were, sinusoidally, if the coil is magnetised and demagnetised at a
  higher rate than the natural period of vibration of the spring. <!-- Page
  40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>{40}</span>This causes
  an irregularity in the rate of the vibrations which affects the received
  image very considerably. A photographic film is wrapped round the drum of
  the machine, being fastened by means of a little celluloid cement smeared
  along one edge.</p>

  <p>This device, although it will work well over artificial conductors, is
  not suitable for wireless work, as it is too coarse in its action; it can
  be made sensitive enough to work at a speed of 1000 to 1500 contacts per
  minute, with a current of .5 milliampere. It is impossible to obtain a
  current of this magnitude from the majority of the detectors in use, so
  that if any attempt is made to use this device for radio-photography it
  will be necessary to employ a Marconi coherer (filings), as this is
  practically the only coherer from which so large a current can be
  obtained.</p>

  <p>There have been many attempts made to receive with an ordinary filings
  coherer, but as was pointed out in Chapter I. these have now been
  discarded in serious wireless work, being only used in small amateur
  stations or experimental sets. As the reasons for this are well known to
  the majority of wireless workers there is no need to enumerate them
  here.</p>

  <p>A method whereby a filings coherer can be decohered, the act of
  decohering closing a local circuit which contains the photographic <!--
  Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page41"></a>{41}</span>receiving apparatus, is given in the diagram
  Fig. 21.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:36%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig21.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig21.png"

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 21.
  </div>

  <p>In the figure, the coherer C is fixed in rigid supports, one support
  being provided with a platinum pin F. To the coherer is connected the
  sensitive electro-magnet M, which becomes magnetised as soon as the
  incoming waves act upon the coherer. To the armature B is attached a
  light aluminium arm S, pivoted at K, and carrying at the other end the
  striker G, which is fitted with a platinum contact. When the armature B
  is attracted the coherer is decohered by the force of the impact between
  the contacts F and G. To prevent damage to the coherer the force of the
  blow is taken off by the ability of the striker to work back through a
  hole in the arm S, the spring <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page42"></a>{42}</span>N keeping it normally in a fixed position. T
  and P are adjusting screws, and the terminals J are for connecting to the
  receiving apparatus. With this arrangement a very short wave-train causes
  only one tap of the contacts, so that only one mark is registered on the
  receiving drum for every contact made on the transmitter.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:39%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig22.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig22.png"

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 22.
  </div>

  <p>The drawing, Fig. 22, gives a diagrammatic representation of apparatus
  arranged for another photographic method of receiving. The machine shown
  in Fig. 6 is used in this case. A is the aerial, E earth, P primary of
  oscillation-transformer, S secondary of transformer, C variable
  condenser, C' block condenser, D detector, X two-way switch, T
  telephone.</p>

  <p>A De' Arsonval galvanometer H is also connected to the switch X, so
  that either the telephone or the galvanometer can be switched in. The
  <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page43"></a>{43}</span>galvanometer can be made sensitive enough to
  work with a current as small as 10<sup>-7</sup> of an ampere, with a
  period of about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>150</sub>th of a second. The screen J
  has a small hole about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch diameter drilled in
  the centre. Under the influence of the brief currents which pass through
  the detector every time a group of waves is received, the mirror of the
  galvanometer swings to-and-fro in front of the screen J, and allows the
  light reflected from the source of light M to pass through the aperture
  in the screen, on to the lens N.</p>

  <p>Round the drum V of the machine is wrapped a sensitive photographic
  film, and this records the movements of the mirror which correspond to
  the contacts on the half-tone print used in transmitting. Every time
  current passes through the galvanometer, the light that is received from
  M,<a name="NtA6" href="#Nt6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> passes through the
  aperture in the screen J, and is focussed by the lens N to a point upon
  the revolving film. As soon as the current ceases, the mirror swings back
  to its original position, and the film is again in darkness. Upon being
  developed a photograph, similar to the negative used for preparing the
  metal print is obtained. If desired the apparatus can be so arranged that
  the received picture is a positive instead of a negative.</p>

<p><!-- Page 44 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>{44}</span></p>

  <p>The detector used should be a Lodge wheel-coherer or a Marconi
  valve-receiver, as these are the only detectors that can be used with a
  recording instrument. If the swing of the galvanometer mirror is too
  great, a small battery with a regulating resistance can be inserted in
  order to limit the movement of the mirror to a very short range; the
  current of course flowing in an opposite direction to the current flowing
  through the coherer.</p>

  <p>In this, as in all other methods of receiving, the results obtained
  depend upon the fineness of the line screen used in preparing the metal
  prints; and as already shown the fineness of the screen that can be used
  is dependent upon the mechanical efficiency of the entire apparatus.</p>

  <p>Another system, and one that has been tried as a possible means of
  recording wireless messages, is as follows. The wireless arrangements
  consist of apparatus similar to that shown in Fig. 22, but instead of a
  Lodge coherer a Marconi valve is used, and an Einthoven galvanometer is
  substituted for the reflecting galvanometer. The Einthoven galvanometer
  consists of a very powerful electro-magnet, the pole pieces of which
  converge almost to points. A very fine silvered quartz thread is
  stretched between the pole pieces, as shown in Fig. 23, the tension being
  adjustable. The period of swing is about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>250</sub>th of
  a second. A hole is bored through the poles, and one of them is fitted

  short focus lens N. The light from M passes through the magnets, and a
  magnified image of the quartz thread is thrown upon the ebonite screen J.
  This screen is provided with a fine slit, and when the galvanometer is at
  rest the shadow of the thread just covers the slit in the screen and
  prevents any light from M reaching the photographic film. Upon signals
  being received the shadow of the thread moves to one side for a long or
  short period, uncovering the slit, and allowing light to pass through.
  The lens R concentrates the collected light to a point upon the revolving
  film. The connections for the complete receiver are given in Fig. 24.</p>

  <p>The modified form of the Einthoven galvanometer, as arranged by
  Professor Korn for use with his selenium machines for photo-telegraphy
  over ordinary land lines, consists of two fine silver wires which are
  displaced in a lateral direction between the pole pieces when traversed
  by a current; the current passing through both wires in the same <!--
  Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>{46}</span>direction. A small shutter of aluminium foil
  is attached to the wires at the optical centre. The silver wires used are
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub> inch in diameter, with a natural period of
  about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>120</sub>th of a second; the length of wires free
  to swing being usually about 5 cm.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:40%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig24.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig24.png"
      alt="Fig. 24." title="Fig. 24." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 24.
  </div>

  <p>The period of the wires depends to a great extent upon their length
  and diameter, and also upon their tension. By using short fine wires the
  period can be made much smaller, but a greater current is required to
  produce a similar displacement. Where the current available, as in
  wireless telegraphy, is very small, and a definite displacement of the
  wires is required, it is at once apparent that with wires of a given
  diameter there is a limit to their length and therefore to the period.
  Finer wires can be used, but here again there is a practical limit to
  their fineness, although galvanometers have been constructed with a
  single silvered quartz thread <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12000</sub>th of an inch
  diameter, which, when placed in a powerful field, will give a good
  displacement with a current as small as 10<sup>-8</sup> ampere. <!-- Page
  47 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"></a>{47}</span></p>

  <p>With the apparatus arranged by the Poulsen Company, given in the
  diagram, Fig. 17, for photographically recording wireless signals, the
  current required to operate the galvanometer for signals transmitted at
  the rate of 1500 a minute is 1 × 10<sup>-6</sup> ampere, while for
  signals up to 2500 a minute a current about 5 × 10<sup>-6</sup> ampere is
  necessary.</p>

  <p>Another very sensitive instrument, employed by M. Belin, and known as
  Blondel's oscillograph, consists of two fine wires stretched between the
  poles of a powerful electro-magnet, a small and very light mirror being
  attached to the centre of the wires. The current passes down one wire and
  up the other, and the wires, together with the mirror, are twisted to a
  degree depending upon the strength of the received current. In order to
  render the instrument dead-beat the moving parts are arranged to work in
  oil. The light reflected from the mirror is made use of in a manner
  similar to that shown in Fig. 22.</p>

  <p>In all photographic methods of receiving, the apparatus must be
  enclosed in some way to prevent any extraneous light from reaching the
  film, or better still placed in a room lighted only by means of a ruby
  light.</p>

  <p>The following method is given more as a suggestion than anything else,
  as I do not think it has been tried for wireless receiving, although it
  is stated to have given some good results over <!-- Page 48 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page48"></a>{48}</span>ordinary land lines. It
  is the invention of Charbonelle, a French engineer, and is quite an
  original idea. His method consists of placing a sheet of carbon paper
  between two sheets of thin white paper, and wrapping the whole tightly
  round the drum of the machine. A hardened steel point is fastened to the
  diaphragm of a telephone receiver, and this receiver is placed so that
  the steel point presses against the sheets of paper. As the diaphragm and
  steel point vibrates under the influence of the received currents marks
  are made by the carbon sheet on the bottom paper.</p>

  <p>Over a line where a fair amount of current is available at the
  receiver, the diaphragm would have sufficient movement to mark the paper,
  but the movement would be very small with the current received from a
  detector. This difficulty could no doubt be overcome to a certain extent
  by making a special telephone receiver, with a large and very flexible
  diaphragm, and wound for a very high resistance. The movement of an
  ordinary telephone diaphragm for a barely audible sound is, measured at
  the centre, about 10<sup>-6</sup> of a c.m. With a unit current the
  movement at the centre is about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>700</sub>th of an inch.
  Greater movement of the diaphragm could be obtained by connecting a
  <i>Telephone relay</i> to the detector, and using the magnified current
  from the relay to operate the telephone. <!-- Page 49 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>{49}</span></p>

      alt="Fig. 25." title="Fig. 25." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 25.
  </div>

  <p>The telephone relay consists of a microphone C, Fig. 25, formed of the
  two pieces of osmium iridium alloy. The contact is separated to a minute
  degree partly by the action of the local current from F, which flows
  through it and also through the winding W of the two magnet coils. The
  local current from F assists in forming the microphone by rendering the
  space between the contacts conductive. The vibrating reed P is fastened
  to the metal frame (not shown) which carries a micrometer screw by which
  the distance between the contacts can be accurately regulated. It will be
  seen from Fig. 25 that the local circuit consists of a battery F (about
  1.5 volts), the microphone contacts C, the windings W, milliampere meter
  B, and the terminals T, for connecting to the galvanometer or telephone,
  all in <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page50"></a>{50}</span>series. On the top of the magnet cores N, S
  is a smaller magnet D, wound with fine wire for a resistance of about
  4935 ohms, the free ends of the coils being connected to the detector
  terminals. The working is as follows. Supposing the current from the
  detector flows through D in such a way that its magnetism is increased,
  the reed P will be attracted, the contacts opened, and their resistance
  increased. It will be seen that the current from F is passed through the
  coils W, in such a way as to increase the magnetism of the permanent
  magnet, so that any opening of the microphone contact increases their
  resistance, causes the current to fall, and weakens the magnets to such
  an extent that the reed P can spring back to its normal position. On the
  other hand, if the detector current flows through D in such a direction
  as to decrease the magnetism in the permanent magnets, the reed P will
  rise and make better contact owing to the removal of the force opposing
  the stiffness of the reed. Owing to the decrease in the resistance of the
  microphone, the strength of the local current will be increased, the
  magnets strengthened, and the reed P will be pulled back to its original
  position. This relay gives a greatly magnified current when properly
  adjusted, the current being easily increased from 10<sup>-4</sup> to
  10<sup>-2</sup> amperes. It is also very sensitive, but needs careful
  adjustment in order that the best results may <!-- Page 51 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>{51}</span>be obtained. A greater
  range of magnification can be obtained by placing two or more relays in
  series.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:23%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig26.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig26.png"

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 26.

  <p>A very sensitive receiver designed by the writer is given in the
  figures 26 and 27. To the centre of a telephone diaphragm is fastened a
  light steel point P, and the movement of this point is communicated to
  the aluminium arm D, which is pivoted at C. As will be seen the telephone
  receiver is of special construction, it containing only one coil and
  therefore only one core; by this means the movement of the diaphragm is
  centralised. The coil is wound for a resistance of about 200 ohms, and
  the diaphragm should be fairly thin but very resillient.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:23%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig27.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig27.png"
      alt="Fig. 27." title="Fig. 27." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 27.
  </div>

  <p>To the free end of D is fastened the mirror T, made from thin
  diaphragm glass about 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> centimetres diameter,
  and having a focal length of 40 inches. Light from the lamp L is
  transmitted by the lens N in a parallel beam to the mirror which <!--
  Page 52 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page52"></a>{52}</span>concentrates it to a point upon a hole
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub>th of an inch in diameter in the screen J. As
  the telephone diaphragm vibrates under the influence of the received
  signals the arm, and consequently the mirror, vibrates also, and the hole
  in the screen J is constantly being covered and uncovered by the spot of
  light. It will be seen from Fig. 27 that the ratio between the centre of
  the mirror and the pivot C, and C and the steel point P is 10:1, so that
  if a movement of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20000</sub>th of an inch is obtained
  at the centre of the diaphragm the mirror will move
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2000</sub>th of an inch; and as the focal length of the
  mirror is 40 inches a movement of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub>th inch is
  given to the spot of light.</p>

  <p>This receiver is capable of working at a fairly high speed, as the
  inertia of the moving parts is practically negligible; the weight of the
  arm and mirror being less than 20 grains. The hole in the screen is made
  slightly less in diameter than the traverse of the revolving cylinder,
  the slight distance between the cylinder and the screen allowing the
  light to disperse sufficiently to produce a line on the film of about the
  right thickness.</p>

  <p>There are two other possible means of photographically receiving the
  picture that upon investigation may yield some results; but it is
  doubtful whether the current available, even that obtained from a
  telephone relay, will be sufficient to produce the desired magnetic
  effect, and the <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page53"></a>{53}</span>insertion of a second relay would detract
  greatly from the efficiency by decreasing the speed of working. If rays
  of monochromatic light from a lamp L, Fig. 28, pass through a Nicol prism
  P (polarising prism), then through a tube containing CS<sub>2</sub>
  (carbon bisulphide), afterwards passing through the second prism P'
  (analysing prism), and if the two Nicol prisms are set at the polarising
  angle, no light from L would reach the photographic film wrapped round
  the drum V of the machine. Upon the tube being subjected to a field
  produced by a current passing through the coil C, the refractive index of
  the liquid will be changed, and light from L will reach the photographic
  film.<a name="NtA7" href="#Nt7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 28.
  </div>

  <p>The second method is rather more complicated, and is based upon the
  fact that the kathode rays in a Crookes' tube can be deflected from their
  course by means of a magnet. In Fig. 29 the kathode K of the X-ray tube
  sends a kathode ray discharge through an aperture in the anode A, through
  a small aperture in the ebonite screen J <!-- Page 54 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>{54}</span>on to the drum V of the
  machine, round which is wrapped a photographic film; A and K being
  connected to suitable electrical apparatus. Upon the coil M being
  energised, the kathode-ray is deflected from its straight-line course,
  and the drum V is left in darkness.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 29.
  </div>

  <p>The method which is now going to be described is very ingenious, as it
  makes use of what is known as an electrolytic receiver. This method of
  receiving has proved to be the most practical and simple of all the
  photo-telegraphic systems that have been devised.</p>

  <p>The application of this system to wireless reception is as follows.
  The aerial A, and the earth E, are joined to the primary P of a
  transformer, the secondary S being connected to a Marconi valve receiver
  C. The valve receiver is connected to the battery B and silvered quartz
  thread K of an Einthoven galvanometer (already described). The thread is
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12000</sub>th of an inch in diameter, and will respond
  to currents as small as 10<sup>-8</sup> of <!-- Page 55 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>{55}</span>an ampere. The light from
  M throws an enlarged shadow of the thread over a slit in the screen J,
  and as the thread moves to one side under the influence of a current, the
  slit in J is uncovered, and the light from M is thrown upon a small
  selenium cell R. In the dark the selenium cell has a very high
  resistance, and therefore no current can flow from the battery D to the
  relay F. When the string of the galvanometer moves to one side and
  uncovers the slit in the screen J, a certain amount of light is thrown
  upon the selenium cell lowering its resistance, allowing sufficient
  current to pass through to operate the relay.</p>

  <p>Round the drum of the machine (shown in Fig. 7) is wrapped a sheet of
  paper that has been soaked in certain chemicals that are decomposed on
  the passage of an electric current through them. As soon as the local
  circuit of the relay is closed, the current from the battery Z (about 12
  volts) flows through the paper and produces a coloured mark. The picture,
  therefore, is composed of long or short marks which correspond to the
  varying strips of conducting material on the single line print. In order
  to render the marks short and crisp, a small battery Y, and regulating
  resistance L, is placed across the drum and stylus. The diagram, Fig. 30,
  gives the connections for the complete receiver. <!-- Page 56 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>{56}</span></p>

  <p>The paper used is soaked in a solution consisting of</p>

      alt="Fig. 30." title="Fig. 30." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 30.
  </div>

  <p>The paper has to be very carefully chosen, as besides being absorbent
  enough to remain moist during the whole of the receiving, the surface
  must also remain fairly smooth, as with a rough paper the grain shows
  very distinctly, and if there is an excess of solution the electrolytic
  marks are inclined to spread and so cause a blurred image. The writer
  tried numerous specimens of paper before one could be found that gave
  really satisfactory results. It was also found that when working in a
  warm room the paper became nearly <!-- Page 57 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>{57}</span>dry before the receiving
  was finished, and the resistance of the paper being greatly increased
  (this may be anything up to 1000 ohms), the marking became very faint. A
  sponge moistened with the solution and applied to the undecomposed
  portion of the paper, while still revolving, was found to help matters
  considerably.</p>

  <p>Another experience which happened during the writer's early
  experiments, the cause of which I am still unable to explain, occurred in
  connection with the stylus. The stylus used consisted of a sharply
  pointed steel needle, and after working for about three minutes it was
  noticed that the lines were becoming gradually wider, finally running
  into each other. Upon examination it was found that the point of the
  needle had worn away considerably, becoming in fact, almost a chisel
  point. Almost every needle tried acted in a similar manner, and to
  overcome this difficulty the stylus shown in Fig. 31 was devised.</p>

  <p>It will be seen that it consists of a holder A, somewhat resembling a
  drill chuck, fastened to the flat spring B in such a manner that the
  angle the stylus makes to the drum can be altered. The needle consists of
  a length of 36-gauge steel wire, and as this wears away slowly the jaws
  of the holder can be loosened and a fresh length pushed through. The wire
  should not project beyond the face of the holder more than
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>th inch. The gauge <!-- Page 58 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>{58}</span>of wire chosen would not
  suit every machine, the best gauge to use being found by trial, but in
  the writer's machine the pitch of the decomposition marks is much finer
  than of those made by the commercial machines, and this gauge, with the
  slight but unavoidable spreading of the marks, will produce a mark of
  just the right thickness. As already mentioned, no explanation of this
  peculiarity on the part of the stylus can be given, as there is nothing
  very corrosive in the solution used, and the pressure of the stylus upon
  the paper is so slight as to be almost negligible.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:30%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig31.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig31.png"
      alt="Fig. 31." title="Fig. 31." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 31.
  </div>

  <p>No special means are required for fastening the paper to the drum, the
  moist paper adhering quite firmly. Care should be taken, however, to
  fasten the paper&mdash;which should be long enough to allow for a lap of
  about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch&mdash;in such a manner that when
  working the stylus draws away from the edge of the lap and not towards
  it.</p>

  <p>The current required to produce electrolysis is very small, about one
  milliampere being sufficient. <!-- Page 59 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page59"></a>{59}</span>Providing that the voltage is sufficiently
  high, decomposition will take place with practically "no current," it
  being possible to decompose the solution with the discharge from a small
  induction coil. The quantity of an element liberated is by weight the
  product of time, current, and the electro-chemical equivalent of that
  element, and is given by the equation W = <i>zct</i>, where</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>W = quantity of element liberated in grammes.</p>
      <p><i>z</i> = electro-chemical equivalent,</p>
      <p><i>c</i> = current in amperes,</p>
      <p><i>t</i> = time in seconds.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The chemical action that takes place is therefore very small, as the
  intermittent current sent out from the transmitter in some cases only
  lasts from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub>th to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub>th
  a second.</p>

  <p>The decomposed marks on the paper are blue, and, as photographers
  know, blue is reproduced in a photograph as a white, so that a photograph
  taken of our electrolytic picture, which will of course be a blue image
  upon a white ground, will be reproduced almost like a blank sheet of
  paper. If, however, a yellow contrast filter is placed in front of the
  camera lens, and an orthochromatic plate used, the blue will be
  reproduced in the photograph as a dead black.</p>

  <p>There is one other point that requires attention. It will be noticed
  that the metal print used for <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page60"></a>{60}</span>transmitting is a positive, since it is
  prepared from a negative. The received picture will therefore be a
  negative, making the final reproduction, if it is to be used for
  newspaper work, a negative also. Obviously this is no good. The final
  reproduction must be a positive, therefore the received picture must be
  also a positive. To overcome this difficulty matters must be so arranged
  at the receiving station that in the cases of Figs. 17, 18, 22, and 24,
  the film is kept permanently illuminated while the stylus on the
  transmitter is tracing over an insulating strip, and in darkness when
  tracing over a conducting strip. In Fig. 30 the relay F should allow a
  continuous current from Z to flow through the electrolytic paper, and
  only broken when the resistance of the selenium cell is sufficiently
  reduced to allow the current from D to operate the relay.</p>

  <p>The author has endeavoured to make direct positives on glass of the
  picture to be transmitted, so that a negative metal print could be
  prepared. The results obtained were not very satisfactory, but the method
  tried is given, as it may perhaps be of interest. The plate used in the
  camera has to be exposed three or four times longer than is required for
  an ordinary negative. The exposed plate is then placed in a solution of
  protoxalate of iron (ferrous oxalate) and left until the image shows
  plainly through the back of the plate. It <!-- Page 61 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>{61}</span>is then washed in water
  and placed in a solution consisting of</p>

<table class="nob" summary="Washing solution." title="Washing solution.">

</table>

  <p>After being in this bath for about fifteen minutes the plate is again
  well washed in water, and developed in the ordinary way. The first two
  operations should be performed in the dark room, but the remaining
  operations can be performed in daylight, once the plate has been placed
  in the bichromate bath. As already stated, the results obtained were not
  very satisfactory, and such a method is not now worth following up, as it
  is comparatively easy so to arrange matters at the receiving station that
  a positive or negative image can be received at will.</p>

  <p>It is necessary to connect the stylus of the receiving machine to the
  positive pole of the battery Z, otherwise the marks will be made on the
  underside of the paper. The electrolytic receiver, owing to the absence
  of mechanical and electro-magnetic inertia, is capable of recording
  signals at a very high speed indeed.</p>

  <p>"Atmospherics," which are such a serious nuisance in long-distance
  wireless telegraphy, will also prove a nuisance in wireless photography,
  <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>{62}</span>but
  their effects will not be so serious in a photographic method of
  receiving as they would be in the electrolytic system. In a photographic
  receiver where the film is, under normal conditions, constantly
  illuminated, the received signals (both the transmitted signals and the
  atmospheric disturbances) will be recorded, after development, as
  transparent marks upon the film, the remainder of the film being, of
  course, perfectly opaque. By careful retouching the marks due to the
  disturbances can be eradicated, a print upon sensitised paper having been
  first obtained to act as a guide during the process.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p class="cenhead">SYNCHRONISING AND DRIVING</p>

  <p>Clockwork and electro-motors are the source of driving power that are
  most suitable for photo-telegraphic work, and each has its superior
  claims depending on the type of machine that is being used. For general
  experimental work, however, an electro-motor is perhaps the most
  convenient, as the speed can be regulated within very wide limits. For a
  constant and accurate drive a falling weight has no equal, but the
  apparatus required is very cumbersome and the work of winding both
  tedious and heavy. This method of driving was at one time universally
  employed with the Hughes printing telegraph, but it has now been
  discarded in favour of electro-motors, which are more compact, besides
  being cheaper to instal in the first instance.</p>

  <p>Synchronising and isochronising the two machines are the most
  difficult problems that require solving in connection with wireless
  photography, and as previously mentioned, the <!-- Page 64 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>{64}</span>synchronising of the two
  stations must be very nearly perfect in order to obtain intelligible
  results. The limit of error in synchronising must be about 1 in 500 in
  order to obtain results suitable for publication.</p>

  <p>The electrolytic system is perhaps the easiest to isochronise, as the
  received picture is visible. On the metal print used for transmitting,
  and at the commencing edge a datum line is drawn across in insulating
  ink. The reproduction of this line is carefully observed by the operator
  in charge of the receiving instrument, and the speed of the motor is
  regulated until this line lies close against a line drawn across the
  electrolytic paper. Although this may seem an ideal method there are one
  or two considerations to be taken into account. Unless the decomposition
  marks are made the correct length and are properly spaced, however good
  the isochronising may be, the result will be a blurred image. Any one who
  has worked with a selenium cell, will know that it cannot change from its
  state of high resistance to that of low resistance with infinite
  rapidity, and the effects of this inertia, or "fatigue" as it has been
  called, are more pronounced when working at a high speed. In working, the
  effects of this inertia would be to increase the time of contact of the
  relay F (Fig. 30) as the current from D would flow for a slightly longer
  period through R to F than the period of <!-- Page 65 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>{65}</span>illumination allowed by
  K. This, of course, would mean a lengthening of the marks on the paper;
  results would also differ greatly with different selenium cells. There is
  a method of compensation by which the inertia of a cell can almost
  entirely be overcome, but it would add greatly to the complicacy of the
  receiving apparatus.</p>

  <p>In using an electro-motor with any optical method of receiving there
  are two methods available. The first is an arrangement similar to that
  used by Professor Korn in his early experiments with his selenium
  machines. The motor used for driving has several coils in the armature
  connected with slip rings, from which an alternating current may be
  tapped off; the motor acting partially as a generator, besides doing good
  work as a motor in driving the machine. This alternating current is
  conducted to a frequency meter, which consists of a powerful
  electro-magnet, over which are placed magnetised steel springs, having
  different natural periods of vibration. By means of a regulating
  resistance the motor is run until the spring which has the same period as
  the desired armature speed vibrates freely. The speed of the motors at
  both stations can thus be adjusted with a fair amount of accuracy.
  Another method is to make use of a governor similar to those employed in
  the Hughes printing telegraph system. A drawing of the governor is given
  in Fig. 32. It consists of a <a name="page66"></a> <span class="figright"
  style="width:33%;"><a href="images/illo-fig32.png"><img
  style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig32.png" alt="Fig. 32." title="Fig. 32."
  /></a><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 32.</span> <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>{67}</span>metal frame which
  supports an upright steel bar S, whose ends turn on pivots. This bar is
  rectangular in section. The gear-wheel G is fastened near the bottom of
  this rod and gears with a similar wheel on the shaft of the driving motor
  (not shown). Suspended from the broader sides of S are the two flexible
  arms D, each carrying a brass ball T. These balls are not fastened to the
  arms, but can slide up and down, being held in position by the wire
  springs M, one end of each spring being fastened to the screws C. These
  screws work in a slot cut in the upper part of S, and are connected to
  the adjusting screw E. When E is turned the screws are raised or lowered
  accordingly, and also the balls on the arms D.</p>

  <p>Fastened to the arms are two brushes of tow B, and these revolve
  inside but just clearing the inner surface of the steel ring Z. Upon the
  motor speed increasing above the normal the arms D, and consequently the
  balls T, swing out, making a larger circle, causing the brushes B to
  press against the steel ring Z, setting up friction which, however, is
  reduced as soon as the motor regains its ordinary working speed. By
  careful adjustment the speed of the motors can be kept perfectly
  constant. The object of having the balls T adjustable on D, is to provide
  a means of altering the motor speed, as the lower the balls on D the
  slower the mechanism runs, and <i>vice versa</i>. <!-- Page 68 --><span

  class="sc">Fig.</span> 33.</span></p>

  <p>A simple and effective speed regulator devised by the writer is given
  in drawings 33 and 34. It comprises two parts, A and B, the part A being
  connected to the driving motor, and the part B working independently. The
  independent portion B consists of an ordinary clock movement M, a steel
  spindle J being geared to one of the slower moving wheels, so that it
  makes just one revolution in two seconds. This spindle, which runs in two
  coned bearings, carries at its outer end a light <span class="figleft"
  style="width:36%;"><a href="images/illo-fig34.png"><img
  style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig34.png" alt="Fig. 34." title="Fig. 34."
  /></a><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 34.</span> pointer D, about two inches
  long, to the underside of which is fastened the thin brass contact spring
  S, which presses lightly upon the ebonite ring N. <!-- Page 69 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>{69}</span>The portion A comprises a
  spindle, pointer, and contact spring similar to those employed in B, the
  spindle J' being geared to the driving motor by means of F, so that the
  pointer D' makes a little more than one revolution in two seconds. By
  means of a special form of brake on the driving motor, the speed is
  reduced, so that both pointers travel at the same rate, viz. one
  revolution in two seconds. By careful adjustment the two pointers can be
  made to revolve in synchronism,<a name="NtA9"
  href="#Nt9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> and when this is obtained the contact
  springs S, S', pass over the contacts C, C', completing the circuit of
  the battery B and lamp L. When working properly the lamp L lights up
  regularly once every second. This regulator is an excellent one to use
  for experimental work, although it depends a great deal upon the skill of
  the operator, but good adjustment should be obtained in about two
  minutes. It is a good plan to insert a clutch of some description between
  the driving motor and the machine, so that the regulator can be adjusted
  prior to the act of receiving or transmitting, the machine being
  prevented from revolving by means of a catch. The motor used should be
  powerful enough to take up the work of driving the machine without any
  reduction in speed. The clocks M can be regulated so that they only gain
  or lose a few seconds in <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>{70}</span>twenty-four hours, which gives an accuracy
  in working sufficient for all practical purposes.</p>

  <p>Connection is made with the contact springs S, S', by means of the
  springs T, T', which press against the spindles J, J'.</p>

  <p>Another important point is the correct placing of the picture upon the
  receiving drum. It is necessary that the two machines besides revolving
  in perfect isochronism should synchronise as well, <i>i.e.</i> begin to
  transmit and record at exactly the same position on the cylinders, viz.
  at the edge of the lap, so that the component parts of the received image
  shall occupy the same position on the paper or film as they do on the
  metal print. If the receiving cylinder had, let us suppose, completed a
  quarter of a revolution before it started to reproduce, the reproduction
  when removed from the machine and opened out will be found to be
  incorrectly placed; the bottom portion of the picture being joined to the
  top portion, or <i>vice versa</i>, and this means that perhaps an
  important piece of the picture would be rendered useless even if the
  whole is not spoilt. It is evident, therefore, that some arrangement must
  be employed whereby synchronism, as well as isochronism of the two
  instruments can be maintained.</p>

  <p>There are several methods of synchronising that are in constant use in
  high-speed telegraphy, in which the limit of error is reduced to a
  minimum, <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>{71}</span>and some modification of these methods will
  perhaps solve the problem, but it must be remembered that synchronism is
  far easier to obtain where the two stations are connected by a length of
  line than where the two stations are running independently.</p>

  <p>In one system of ordinary photo-telegraphy synchronism is obtained in
  the following manner. The receiving cylinder travels at a speed slightly
  in excess of the transmitting cylinder, and as its revolution is finished
  first is prevented from revolving by a check, and when in this position
  the receiving apparatus is thrown out of circuit and an electro-magnet
  which operates the check is switched in. When the transmitting cylinder
  has completed its revolution (about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub>th of a
  second later) the transmitting apparatus, by means of a special
  arrangement, is thrown out of circuit for a period, just long enough for
  a powerful current to be sent through the line. This current actuates the
  electro-magnet. The check is withdrawn and the receiving cylinder
  commences a fresh revolution in perfect synchronism with the transmitting
  cylinder. As soon as the check is withdrawn the receiving apparatus is
  again placed in circuit until another revolution is completed. As the
  receiver cannot stop and start abruptly at the end of each revolution a
  spring clutch is inserted between the driving motor and the machine. <!--
  Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>{72}</span></p>

  <p>Although a method of synchronising similar to this may later on be
  devised for wireless photography, the writer, from the result of his own
  experiments, is led to believe that results good enough for all practical
  purposes can be obtained by fitting a synchronising device whereby the
  two machines are started work at the same instant, and relying upon the
  perfect regulation of the speed of the motors for correct working.</p>

  <p>The method of isochronism must, however, be nearly perfect in its
  action, as it is easy to see that with only a very slight difference in
  the speed of either machine this error will, when multiplied by 40 or 50
  revolutions, completely destroy the received picture for practical
  purposes.</p>

  <p>From what has been written in this and in the preceding chapters it
  will be evident that the successful solution of transmitting photographs
  by wireless methods will necessitate the use of a great many pieces of
  apparatus all requiring delicate adjustment, and depending largely upon
  each other for efficient working. As previously stated, there is at
  present no real system of wireless photography, the whole science being
  in a purely experimental stage, but already Professor Korn has succeeded
  in transmitting photographs between Berlin and Paris, a distance of over
  700 miles. If such a distance could be worked over successfully, there is
  no reason to doubt that before long <!-- Page 73 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>{73}</span>we shall be able to
  receive pictures from America with as great reliability and precision as
  we now receive messages.</p>

  <p>In nearly all wireless photographic systems devised up to the present
  the chief portion of the receiver consists of a very sensitive
  galvanometer, and although very good results have been obtained by their
  use they are more or less a nuisance, as the extreme delicacy of their
  construction renders them liable to a lot of unnecessary movement caused
  by external disturbances. A galvanometer of the De' Arsonval pattern,
  used by the writer, was constantly being disturbed by merely walking
  about the room, although placed upon a fairly substantial table; and for
  the same reason it was impossible to attempt to place the driving motor
  of the machine on the same table as the galvanometer. For ship-board work
  it will be evident that the use of such a sensitive instrument presents a
  great difficulty to successful working, and a good opening exists for
  some piece of apparatus&mdash;to take the place of the
  galvanometer&mdash;that will be as sensitive in its action but more
  robust in its construction.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p class="cenhead">THE "TELEPHOGRAPH"</p>

  <p>In the present chapter it is proposed to give a brief description of a
  system of radio-photography devised by the author, and which includes a
  greatly improved method of transmitting and receiving, as well as an
  ingenious arrangement for synchronising the two stations; the whole being
  an attempt to produce a system that would be capable of working
  commercially over fairly long distances.</p>

  <p>The system about to be described, and which I have designated the
  "telephograph," is the outcome of several years' original experimental
  work, many difficulties that were manifest in the working of the earlier
  systems having been overcome by apparatus that has been expressly
  designed for the purpose.</p>

  <p>In any practical system of radio-photography the following points are
  of great importance: (1) the speed of transmission; (2) the quality of
  the received picture; (3) the method of synchronising <!-- Page 75
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"></a>{75}</span>the two machines
  so that transmission and reception begin simultaneously; (4) the correct
  regulation of the speed of the driving motors; (5) the simplicity and
  reliability of the entire arrangement. Points 1 and 2 are dependent upon
  several factors; the number of contacts made by the stylus per minute;
  the size of the metal print used; the number of lines per inch on the
  screen used in preparing the print; and the accurate and harmonious
  working of the various pieces of apparatus employed.</p>

  <p>In the system under discussion the size of the metal print used is 5
  inches by 7 inches, and a screen having 50 lines to the inch is used for
  preparing it. With the drum of the machine making one revolution in four
  seconds, the stylus makes 87 contacts per second, or 5220 a minute, the
  time for complete transmission being twenty-five minutes. By the use of
  ordinary relays not more than 2000 contacts a minute can be obtained, and
  in the present system it is only by means of a specially designed relay
  that such a high rate of working has been made possible. Similarly, too,
  with the receiving of such a large number of signals transmitted at such
  a high speed, a special instrument has been devised that can record this
  number of signals without any trouble, and could even record up to 8000
  signals a minute, provided that a suitable transmitter could be designed.
  <!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page76"></a>{76}</span></p>

  <p>In the present system the writer does not claim to have completely
  solved the problem of the wireless transmission of photographs, but it is
  a great advance on any system previously described, and the following
  advantages are put forward for recognition: (1) a greatly improved method
  of transmitting and receiving; (2) a simple method of regulating the
  speed of the driving motors and maintaining isochronism with a limit of
  error of less than 1 in 800; (3) an arrangement for synchronising the two
  machines whereby transmitting and receiving begin simultaneously; (4) the
  use of one machine only at each station.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Transmitting Apparatus</span></p>

  <p>A diagrammatic representation of the apparatus required for a complete
  station, transmitting and receiving combined, is given in Fig. 35, the
  usual wireless equipment having been omitted from the diagram to avoid
  confusion.</p>

  <p><i>The Machine.</i>&mdash;This, as will be seen from Fig. 36, consists
  of a base-plate M, to which are attached the two bearings B and B'. The
  bearing B' is fitted with an internal thread to correspond with the
  threaded portion of the shaft D. The drum V is a brass casting, being
  fastened to the shaft by set screws. The shaft is threaded 75 to the
  inch. The bearings are preferably of the concentric type. The circuit
  breaker C is so arranged that when <!-- Page 77 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>{77}</span>the drum has traversed
  the required distance, the end of the shaft pushes back the spring M,
  breaking the circuit of the driving gear and stopping the machine. The
  machine is connected to the driving gear by the flexible coupling A.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The drum measures 5 inches long by 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches
  diameter, and this takes a metal print 5 inches by 7 inches, which allows
  for a lap of about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch. In working, the print
  is wrapped tightly round the drum, being secured by means of a little
  seccotine smeared along one edge. Care must be taken that the edge of the
  lap draws away from the point of <!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page78"></a>{78}</span>the stylus and not towards it. A margin of
  bare foil, about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch wide, should be left on
  the print at the commencing edge, the purpose of which will be explained
  later.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:36%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig. 36.</span>
  </div>

  <p><i>The Stylus.</i>&mdash;As the drum of the machine travels laterally,
  by reason of the threaded shaft and bearing, the stylus must necessarily
  be a fixture. It consists of a holder B, drilled to take a hardened steel
  point S, attached to the spring M. The spring is arranged to work in the
  guide F, which is provided with an adjusting screw W for regulating the
  pressure of the stylus upon the print; the pressure being sufficient to
  enable good contact to be made, but must not be heavy enough to scratch
  the soft foil. The needle should present an angle of about 60° to the
  surface of the print, as this angle has been found to give the best
  results in working.</p>

  <p>To eliminate any sparking that may take place at the point of make and
  break, due to the self-induction of the relay coils, a condenser C, about
  1 microfarad capacity, should be connected across <!-- Page 79 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page79"></a>{79}</span>the drum and stylus. The
  complete stylus is given in the drawings, Figs. 37, 37<i>a</i>, and also
  in the diagrams Figs. 8 and 9.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 37</span><i>a</i>.
  </div>

  <p><i>The Relay.</i>&mdash;As will be seen from the diagram, Fig. 38,
  this consists of two electro-magnets having very soft iron cores, the
  magnet M being wound in the usual manner, while the magnet N is wound
  differentially. The armature A is made as light as possible, and is
  pivoted at P, and when there is no current flowing through any of the
  coils, is held midway between the magnet cores by the two spiral springs
  S and T, which are under slight but equal tension. The connections are as
  follows. The wires from the winding on M are connected directly to the
  relay terminals F and H, as are also the wires from one winding on N. The
  other winding on N is connected in series with the battery C, ammeter B,
  and regulating resistance R. <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page80"></a>{80}</span></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:36%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig38.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig38.png"
      alt="Fig. 38" title="Fig. 38" /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig. 38.</span>
  </div>

  <p>When the circuit of the battery C is completed, the coil of N, to
  which it is connected, is energised, and the armature A is attracted
  against the stop V. When in this position the tension of the spring S is
  released, while the tension of the spring T is increased. As soon as the
  circuit of the battery D is completed by means of the metal line print on
  the transmitting machine, the current divides at the terminals F and H, a
  portion flowing through the magnet coil M, and a portion through the
  remaining winding on N. The current which flows through the winding on N
  produces a magnetising effect equal to that caused by the other winding
  on N, but since the two windings are of equal length and resistance, and
  since the current flowing through the two windings is of equal strength
  but in opposite directions, the result is to neutralise <!-- Page 81
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>{81}</span>the magnetising
  effects produced by each winding, and consequently no magnetism is
  produced in the cores.</p>

  <p>The other portion of the current from D flows through the coil M, and
  it becomes magnetised at the same time that the coil N becomes
  demagnetised. The armature A is attracted by M against the stop X, and
  this attraction is assisted by the spring T, which was under increased
  tension. The conditions of the springs are now reversed, the spring S
  being under increased tension, while the tension of the spring T is
  released.</p>

  <p>As soon as the current from D is broken, the magnetism disappears from
  M, the neutralising current in N ceases, and N once more becomes
  magnetised, owing to the current which still flows through one winding
  from C; the armature is therefore again attracted by N, assisted by the
  spring S. The current flowing through the two windings of N must be
  perfectly equal, and the regulating resistance R, and ammeters B and B',
  are inserted for purposes of adjustment. The current from C must flow in
  a direction opposite to that which flows from D.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The local circuit of the relay is completed by means of a copper
  dipper in mercury, somewhat resembling an ordinary mercury break, but
  modified to suit the present requirements. The arrangement will be seen
  from Fig. 39. The whole of the <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page82"></a>{82}</span>moving parts are made as light as possible,
  and for this reason the rod C and the dippers F, F' should be made as
  short as convenient. The containers H, H' are separate, of cast iron, and
  rectangular in shape. The dipper is of very thin copper tube&mdash;an
  advantage where alternating current is to be used&mdash;and is made
  adjustable for height on the suspending rod C. The leg F is of such a
  length that permanent contact is made with the mercury in the container
  H, while the leg F' clears the surface of the mercury by about
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch, when the armature of the relay is in its
  normal position. To prevent undue churning of the mercury, which would
  necessarily take place if the dipper entered and left the mercury at each
  movement of the armature, a pointed ebonite plug is inserted in the end
  of the tube. This will be found to give good results at a high speed, the
  mercury being practically undisturbed, and the production of "sludge"
  reduced to a minimum. To prevent oxidation of the mercury, and to prevent
  arcing, the surface is covered with paraffin oil. If this is not
  sufficient to prevent arcing a condenser should be shunted across the
  <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page83"></a>{83}</span>containers. The volume of mercury, and the
  area of the dippers, should be sufficient to carry the current used for a
  considerable period without heating up to any extent. An adjustable
  weight J is provided in order to balance the armature and dipping
  rod.</p>

  <p>The remaining transmitting apparatus consists of the battery
  D<sup>2</sup> and the usual wireless apparatus. The double-pole two-way
  switch B' is to enable the photo-telegraphic set to be switched out and
  the hand key W switched in for ordinary signalling purposes. The battery
  D<sup>2</sup> should be about 12 volts.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Receiving Apparatus</span></p>

  <p>The wireless portion of the receiver is similar to that given in Fig.
  22, is of the usual syntonic type, and comprises an oscillation
  transformer, S being the secondary, and P the primary; C' is a block
  condenser, and C a variable condenser. The detector D is of the
  carborundum crystal or electrolytic pattern. A two-way switch B is
  provided so that the relay U can be switched out and the telephones J
  switched in for ordinary receiving purposes. The relay U is a Brown's
  telephone relay.</p>

  provided, and this should be wound with No. 47 S.S.C. copper wire for a
  resistance of about 2000 ohms. By using only one coil and therefore only
  one core, the movement of the diaphragm is centralised. To the centre of
  the diaphragm a light steel point is fastened, about
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch long, and provided with a projecting hook
  H. An enlarged view of this pin is given in Fig. 41. The movement of the
  diaphragm and consequently of the steel point P is communicated to a
  pivoted rod R, which is of special construction. A piece of aluminium
  tube 3<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches long, and of the section given at
  B, is bushed at one end with a piece of brass of the shape shown in Fig.
  41<i>a</i>. A stiff steel wire T about 1 inch long (20 gauge) is screwed
  into the end of Z, and carries a counterbalance weight C. A hardened <!--
  Page 85 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>{85}</span>steel
  spindle, pointed at both ends, is fastened at D, and runs between two
  coned bearings, one of which is adjustable. The underside of Z is
  flattened, and a small coned depression is made for the reception of the
  pointed end of the pin. By means of the spring J the two pieces, Z and P,
  are held firmly together, at the same time allowing perfect freedom of
  movement. The bridge G is made from a piece of sheet aluminium placed in
  a slot cut in the tube R, the end of the tube being pressed tight upon G,
  and secured by means of a small rivet.</p>

  <p>The optical arrangements are as follows. By means of the Nernst lamp
  L, and the lenses B and B', Figs. 42 and 43, a magnified shadow of G is
  thrown upon the screen J. When the shutter G is in its normal position
  (<i>i.e.</i> at rest), its shadow is just above the small hole in J, and
  light from L reaches the photographic film wrapped round the drum V of
  the machine.</p>

  <p>When, however, signals are sent out from the transmitting apparatus,
  the magnified current from the relay U energises the coil of the special
  telephone S, attracting the diaphragm F, and consequently giving movement
  to the pivoted rod R. As by means of the optical arrangements a <!-- Page
  86 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>{86}</span>magnified
  movement as well as a magnified image of G is thrown upon the screen J,
  the shadow of G will, when the telephone S is actuated, cover the hole in
  the screen, and prevent any light from reaching the film on V, until
  current from the relay U ceases to flow. Therefore, when the stylus of
  the transmitter traces over a conducting strip on the metal print, no
  light reaches the film on V, but when tracing over an insulating strip
  the shadow of G on the screen J rises, and the light from L reaches the
  film. By this means a positive picture is received, which is a great
  advantage where the photographs are required for reproduction.
  Atmospherics would be represented by irregular transparent marks on the
  film after development, and these can be easily eradicated by
  retouching.</p>

  <p>The drum of the machine moves laterally <sup>1</sup>/<sub>75</sub>th
  of an inch per revolution, and the hole in the screen is
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>90</sub>th of an inch in diameter. As the screen J is
  not in direct contact with the film, the slight diffusion of the light
  that takes place will produce <!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page87"></a>{87}</span>a mark of about the right thickness. With a
  movement of the diaphragm of only <sup>1</sup>/<sub>40000</sub>th of an
  inch, the actual movement of G will be <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4000</sub>th of
  an inch. If the optical arrangements have a magnifying power of 100, then
  the movement of the shadow upon the screen will be
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>40</sub>th of an inch, which will be ample to cover the
  aperture.</p>

  <p>The aluminium rod R, minus the counter-weight, can be made to weigh
  not more than 12 grains. It is necessary to enclose the optical parts in
  a light tight box, indicated by the dotted lines in Fig. 43, in order to
  prevent any extraneous light from reaching the film.</p>

  <p><i>The Contact Breaker.</i>&mdash;The contact breaker (L, Fig. 35), as
  will be seen from Fig. 44, consists of an electro-magnet N, the windings
  of which are connected with the battery B and the polarised relay K. The
  armature which is supported by the spring G carries a contact arm A,
  which in its normal position makes permanent contact with the contact
  screw T, and completes the circuit between the relay K and the telephone
  relay U (Fig. 35). As soon as the transmitter sends out the first signal,
  the magnified current from the telephone relay actuates the relay K,
  which in turn completes the circuit of the contact breaker. Directly the
  armature M has been attracted, the contact with T is broken, and A makes
  fresh contact with the screw H, by means of the spring Z <!-- Page 88
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>{88}</span>fastened to the
  underside of A. The armature, once it has been attracted, is held in
  permanent contact with H by the catch S, independent of the magnets N. As
  soon as contact is made with H, the clutch (F, Fig. 35) circuit is
  completed, and the circuit of the relay K is broken. When the circuit of
  the clutch F is broken by means of the circuit breaker C on the machine
  (Fig. 36), the stop S is pulled back by hand, allowing the contact arm A
  to rise, and again make fresh contact with the contact screw T.</p>

  <p><i>The Friction Brake.</i>&mdash;This consists of a steel disc A, Fig.
  45, about 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches diameter and
  <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch wide on
  the face, secured to the main shaft of the driving motor. The arm H,
  pivoted at C, carries at one end the curved block B, which is faced with
  a pad of tow F. The other extremity is pivoted to the steel rod P, which
  slides <!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page89"></a>{89}</span><span class="figright" style="width:23%;"><a
  href="images/illo-fig45.png"><img style="width:100%"

  class="sc">Fig.</span> 45.</span> in holes bored in the standards J. One
  end of the rod P is screwed with a fine thread, about 75 to the inch, and
  is fitted with a regulating wheel T, by means of which the block B can be
  made to press upon the disc A with any required degree of pressure. A
  fairly stiff steel spring R is placed upon the rod P, between one
  standard J and the collar N. As the speed of the driving motor is
  slightly in excess of that required by the machine, the block B, by means
  of the wheel, is made to press upon the disc A, setting up friction which
  reduces the motor speed until the isochroniser indicates that the correct
  working speed has been attained.</p>

  <p><i>The Clutch</i>.&mdash;The details of this will be seen from Figs.
  46 and 47. It consists of a steel shaft coned at both ends running
  between two countersunk bearings, one of which is adjustable. This shaft
  carries the two portions of the clutch A and B, the portion A being a
  fixture on the shaft, and the portion B running free upon it. The portion
  B is a gun-metal casting bored to run accurately upon the steel shaft. A
  soft iron annular ring is fastened to the face.</p>

  shaft E, secured by means of a set screw. The two magnet cores P are
  screwed into the front plate V, which is also of gun-metal, and after the
  bobbins R have been slipped on, the shanks of the cores are passed
  through holes drilled in the flange N of the main casting and held in
  place with nuts. The faces of both A and B must be turned perfectly
  square with the shaft, so that they run accurately together. The portion
  B is <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page91"></a>{91}</span>kept in contact with A by means of a spring
  S, the pressure being regulated by the collar H. Current is taken to the
  magnets by means of the two insulated copper rings D mounted upon the
  body of A. The gear-wheels on both portions have teeth of very fine
  pitch, the number of teeth on each being regulated by the speed of the
  driving motor and the required machine speed. Connection with the circuit
  breaker L and the battery B<sup>2</sup> is made with the collecting rings
  D by the brushes T. The complete connections are given in the diagram
  Fig. 51.</p>

  <p><i>The Isochroniser.</i>&mdash;This is a device for ensuring the
  correct speed regulation of the driving motors, and is shown in detail in
  Fig. 48. It comprises two portions, one portion being rotated at a
  definite speed by electrical means, and the other portion rotated by the
  driving motor.</p>

  <p>The main portion consists of a metal tube N, bushed at both ends, the
  bottom end of the tube being arranged to work on ball-bearings. An
  ebonite bush C carries three copper rings T, T<sup>1</sup>,
  T<sup>2</sup>, and the brushes R, R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup> are in
  electrical contact with them. The ebonite plate J,
  3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches diameter, is secured to the top end of
  N, and carries a contact piece Q, shown separate at E. As will be seen
  this is a block of ebonite with three contacts arranged on the top
  surface. The middle contact P is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>64</sub>th of an inch
  wide, and the contacts P<sup>1</sup> <!-- Page 92 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>{92}</span>and P<sup>2</sup> are
  placed on either side at a distance of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> inch;
  the contact strips P<sup>1</sup>, P<sup>2</sup> carry the brass pins D,
  which are about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub> inch diameter, and spaced
  <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch apart. A connecting wire is carried from
  the contact P to the copper ring T, another from P<sup>1</sup> to
  T<sup>1</sup>, and one from P<sup>2</sup> to T<sup>2</sup>.</p>

  <p>The bushes S are bored a running fit for the steel rod W (shown
  separate at A), which is coned at both ends, and runs between two
  countersunk bearings, the bottom bearing E being fixed while <!-- Page 93
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>{93}</span>the top bearing
  (not shown) is adjustable. A needle K is fastened near the end of the rod
  W, and attached to this needle is the spring Z, which presses lightly but
  firmly upon the contact block Q. To provide a level surface for Z to work
  over, the spaces between the contact pieces are filled in with an
  insulating material, and the whole surface finished off perfectly smooth.
  The spring Z is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch wide for portion of its
  length, but at the point where it presses upon Q it is reduced in width
  to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>64</sub>th of an inch (see Fig. 48). The driving
  arrangements are as follows. A counter-shaft Q, Fig. 51, fitted with a
  grooved pulley, is run in bearings parallel with the shaft W, and is
  connected by suitable gearing to the shaft of the driving motor, so that
  the needle K makes one revolution in about 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
  seconds. A belt passing over the pulleys connects the two shafts, and the
  tension of the belt is regulated by means of an adjustable jockey
  pulley.</p>

  <p>The tube N, carrying the disc J, must be rotated at a fixed speed, and
  this is accomplished in the following manner. An ordinary electric clock
  impulse dial, actuated from a master clock, is connected by suitable
  gearing H, so that the tube N makes exactly one revolution in 2 seconds;
  it being possible to adjust an electric clock of the "Synchronome" type,
  so that it only gains or loses about 1 second in 24 hours, and this
  provides <!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page94"></a>{94}</span>an accuracy sufficient for all practical
  purposes. The connections are given in Fig. 49, and the face of the
  instrument in Fig. 50. It will be seen that a connecting wire is run from
  the steel spindle W to one terminal each of the lamps L, L<sup>1</sup>,
  L<sup>2</sup>, and from the other terminal of the lamps to one terminal
  of the batteries J, the battery comprising a set of three 4-volt
  accumulators. The other terminals of the batteries are joined one to each
  of the brushes R, R<sup>1</sup>, R<sup>2</sup>.</p>

  <p>The lamps are coloured, the lamp L being white, and the lamps
  L<sup>1</sup> and L<sup>2</sup> blue and red respectively, and care must
  be taken in connecting up that when the needle K makes contact with the
  stud P the white lamp L is in circuit. When the machines are working, the
  operator, by means of the brake (already described), reduces the speed of
  the driving motor until the needle K travels in unison with the disc J,
  making permanent contact with P on the contact <!-- Page 95 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>{95}</span>block Q, which is
  evidenced by the lamp L remaining alight. If, however, the needle travels
  faster than the disc J, contact with P is broken and fresh contact is
  made with P<sup>2</sup>, the lamp L is extinguished and the red lamp
  L<sup>2</sup> lights up, and remains alight until the operator reduces
  the speed. Similarly, too, if the needle travels slower than J, contact
  is made with P<sup>1</sup>, and the circuit of the blue lamp
  L<sup>1</sup> is completed. When the speed is either above or below the
  normal, the needle K engages with one or the other of the pins D, and as
  the tension of the driving belt is only such as is required to drive the
  needle, the belt slips on the pulleys until the normal speed is
  regained.</p>

<p class="cenhead"><span class="sc">Method of Working</span></p>

  <p>The clockwork motor M, Fig. 51, should be capable of running for
  several hours with one winding, and powerful enough to take up the work
  of driving the machine without any appreciable effort. The main spindle
  of the motor is so arranged that it makes one revolution in two minutes,
  and the reduction in speed between the motor shaft and the shaft to which
  the coupling A is attached is 30:1. The metal line print having been
  wrapped round the drum of the machine, the stylus is put into position,
  at the edge of the lap, and with the needle resting about half-way on
  <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>{96}</span>the
  margin of the bare foil left at the commencing edge of the print. Now,
  when the two stations are in perfect readiness for work, the motors are
  started and the speed adjusted; the speed of the machine being just under
  one revolution in four seconds.</p>

  <p>The switch D is then closed, and the arm of the switch D<sup>1</sup>
  placed on the contact stud (1), at the transmitting station only. As soon
  as the switches are closed the clutch F comes into action, and the
  transmitting machine begins to revolve. When the whole of the line print
  wrapped round the drum of the machine has passed under the stylus, the
  end of the shaft D, Fig. 36, engages <!-- Page 97 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>{97}</span>with the spring <i>m</i>,
  breaking the clutch circuit and allowing the motor to run free. As soon
  as the machine stops, the switch D is opened and the machine run back to
  its starting position by hand.</p>

  <p>At the receiving station the switch D is also closed, and the arm of
  the switch D<sup>1</sup> placed on the contact stud (2). The closing of
  these switches does not bring the clutch F into operation until current
  from the telephone relay U connected to the wireless receiving apparatus
  works the sensitive polarised relay K, which in turn completes the
  circuit of the circuit-breaker L. When the armature of L is attracted,
  the circuit of the relay K is broken, the circuit of the clutch F is
  completed, and the machine starts revolving.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig. 52.</span>

  <p>The current from the relay U, due to the transmitting stylus passing
  over <i>one</i> contact strip on the metal print, is too brief to actuate
  the heavier mechanism of the relay K, hence the need of the margin of
  bare foil at the commencing edge of the metal print, so that a
  practically continuous current will flow to the relay K until the
  armature is attracted. As, however, the relay is not actuated at the
  receipt of the first signal, and as it is necessary for the machine to
  start recording at a certain point on the film, viz. <!-- Page 98
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"></a>{98}</span>at the edge of
  the lap&mdash;the reason for this was given in Chapter IV.&mdash;the
  starting position of the receiving drum will be similar to that given in
  the diagram Fig. 52, where X indicates the lap of the photographic film,
  and the arrow the direction of rotation.</p>

  <p>It is, of course, obvious that a somewhat similar adjustment must be
  made with regard to the position of the stylus on the metal print at the
  transmitting machine.</p>

  <p>In the present system, as in almost every photographic method of
  receiving that has been described, the Nernst lamp is invariably
  mentioned as the source of illumination. Since the advent of the
  high-voltage metal-filament lamps the Nernst lamp has fallen somewhat
  into disuse for commercial purposes, but it possesses certain
  characteristics that render it eminently suitable for the purpose under
  discussion.</p>

  <p>The main principle of this type of lamp depends upon the discovery
  made by Professor Nernst in 1898, after whom the lamp is named, that
  filaments of certain earthy bodies when raised to a red heat became
  conductive sufficiently well to pass a current which raised it to a white
  heat, and furthermore that the glowing filament emitted a brighter light
  for a given amount of current than carbon filaments.</p>

      alt="Fig. 52a." title="Fig. 52a." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 52<i>a</i>.
  </div>

  <p>Nernst lamps are made in two sizes, the larger <!-- Page 99 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page99"></a>{99}</span>being intended for the
  same work as usually done by arc lamps, and the smaller to replace
  incandescent lamps; the smaller type being made to fit into the ordinary
  bayonet lampholders. The principal parts of a Nernst lamp consist of the
  filament, the heater, the automatic cut-out, and the resistance, and
  their arrangement in the smaller type of lamp is given in the diagram,
  Fig. 52<i>a</i>. The current enters at the positive terminal, passes
  through the heater M, and out through the negative terminal. The filament
  B, which consists of a short length of an infusible earth made of the
  oxides of several rare minerals, of which zirconia is one, is a
  non-conductor at first, but becomes a conductor upon being raised to a
  high temperature by means of the heater M. As soon as the filament
  becomes conductive the current then passes through the automatic cut-out
  H, and the armature D is attracted, thus breaking the heater circuit. The
  current then flows from the positive terminal <!-- Page 100 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>{100}</span><span class="figleft"
  style="width:34%;"><a href="images/illo-fig52b.png"><img
  style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig52b.png" alt="Fig. 52b."
  title="Fig. 52b." /></a><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 52<i>b</i>.</span>
  through the cut-out H, resistance J, and filament B, and from thence out
  of the lamp. Since the resistance of the filament decreases the hotter it
  gets, it is necessary to insert a ballasting resistance in series with it
  which has the opposite property of increasing its resistance as it gets
  hotter, to prevent the filament taking too much current and destroying
  itself. Such a resistance, J, consists of a filament of fine iron wire,
  which, to prevent oxidation from exposure to the air, is enclosed in a
  glass bulb filled with hydrogen gas. Fig. 52<i>b</i> shows the form of
  ballast resistance used in the small and large type of lamp
  respectively.</p>

  <p>Either direct or alternating current can be used with these lamps, and
  with direct current the polarity must be strictly observed, and that the
  positive wire is connected to the positive and the <!-- Page 101 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>{101}</span>negative wire to the
  negative terminal. With the smaller type of lamp once it has been
  correctly placed in its holder it is essential that it should not be
  turned, as a change in the direction of the current will rapidly destroy
  the filament.</p>

  <p>The arrangement of the larger type of Nernst lamp can be readily seen
  from the drawing, Fig. 52<i>c</i>.</p>

  <p>Care must be taken to see that the voltage required by the burner and
  resistance equals the voltage of the supply circuit, and that only parts
  of the same amperage are used together on the same lamp. No advantage is
  obtained by over-running a Nernst lamp, this only shortening its life
  without increasing the light. Under normal conditions the average life of
  the burner is about 700 hours.</p>

  <p>The efficiency of the Nernst lamp is fairly high, being only 1.45 to
  1.75 watts per c.p. The light given is remarkably steady, and the lamps
  are adaptable for all voltages from 100 to 300. In one of the large type
  of lamps for use on a 235-volt <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page102"></a>{102}</span>circuit the burner takes 0.5 ampere at 215
  volts, and the resistance 0.5 ampere at 20 volts, while one of the
  smaller lamps for use on the same circuit takes 0.25 ampere at 215 volts
  and 0.25 ampere at 20 volts for the burner and resistance respectively.
  The burner and heater are very fragile, and should never be handled
  except by the porcelain plate to which they are attached. The lamps burn
  in air and emit a brilliant white light of high actinic power, the
  intrinsic brilliancy (c.p./square inch) varying from 1000 to 2500, as
  compared with 1000 to 1200 for ordinary metal filament lamps, and 300 to
  500 for carbon filament lamps.</p>

  <p>The chief advantage of the Nernst lamp from a photographic point of
  view lies in the fact that it produces abundantly the blue and violet
  rays which have the greatest chemical effect upon a photographic plate or
  film. These rays are known as chemical or actinic rays, and are only
  slightly produced in some types of incandescent electric lamps.
  Carbon-filament lamps are very poor in this respect.</p>

  <p>Because a light is visually brilliant it must by no means be assumed
  that it is the best to use for purposes of photography, and this is a
  point over which many photographers stumble when using artificial light.
  Many sources of light, while excellent for illumination, have very low
  actinic powers, while others may have low illuminating but high <!-- Page
  103 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>{103}</span>actinic
  powers. A lamp giving a light yellowish in colour has usually low actinic
  power, while all those lamps giving a soft white light are generally
  found to be highly actinic.</p>

  <p>In addition to the actinic value of the source of illumination, the
  photographic film used must be very carefully chosen, as the chemical
  inertia of the sensitised film plays an important part in the successful
  reproduction of the picture, and also, to a certain extent, affects the
  speed of transmission. The length of exposure, the amount of light
  admitted to the film, and the characteristics of the film itself, are all
  factors which have a decided bearing upon the quality of the results
  obtained, and the film found to be most suitable in one case will perhaps
  give very unsatisfactory results in another.</p>

  <p>In photo-telegraphy the length of exposure is determined by the time
  taken by the transmitting stylus to trace over a conducting strip on the
  metal print, and this time, of course, varies with the density of the
  image and also with the speed of transmission.</p>

  <p>The film in ordinary photography is chosen with regard to the subject
  and the existing light conditions, and the amount of light admitted to
  the film and the length of exposure are regulated accordingly. No such
  latitude is, however, possible in photo-telegraphy. With each set of
  apparatus <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page104"></a>{104}</span>the various factors, such as the light
  value, the amount of light admitted to the film, and the length of
  exposure, will be practically fixed quantities, and the film that will
  give the most satisfactory results under these fixed conditions can only
  be found by the rough-and-ready method of "trial and error."</p>

  <p>The films in common use are manufactured in four qualities, namely,
  ordinary, studio, rapid, and extra rapid. These terms should really
  relate to the light sensitiveness of the film (or, as it is technically
  termed, the speed), but at the best they are a rough and very
  unsatisfactory guide, for the reason that some unscrupulous makers,
  purely for business purposes, do not hesitate to label their films and
  plates as slow, rapid, etc., without troubling to make any tests for
  correct classification.</p>

  <p>The speed of photographic films and plates is generally indicated by a
  number, and the system of standardisation adopted by the majority of
  makers in this country is that originated by Messrs. Hurter &amp;
  Driffield, abbreviated H. &amp; D. In their system the speed of the film
  and the exposure varies in geometrical proportion, a film marked H. &amp;
  D. 50 requiring double the exposure of one marked H. &amp; D. 100. The
  highest number always denotes the highest speed, and the exposure varies
  inversely with the speed.</p>

  <p>Besides the Hurter &amp; Driffield method of <!-- Page 105 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>{105}</span>obtaining the speed
  numbers of plates and films adopted by a large number of makers in this
  country, there are also two standard English systems known as the W.P.
  No. (Watkin's power number) and Wynne F. No., both of which are used to a
  fair extent.</p>

  <p>The "Actinograph" number or speed number of a plate in the H. &amp; D.
  system is found by dividing 34 by a number known as the Inertia, the
  Inertia, which is a measure of the insensitiveness of the plate, being
  determined according to the directions laid down by Hurter &amp;
  Driffield&mdash;that is, by using pyro-soda developer and the straight
  portion only of the density curve. If, for instance, the Inertia was
  found to be one-fifth, then the speed number would be 34 ÷
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> = 170, and the plate is H. &amp; D. 170. The
  W.P. No. is found by dividing 50 by the Inertia. Thus 50 ÷
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> = 250, and the plate is W.P. 250, but for all
  practical purposes the W.P. No. can be taken as one and a half times H.
  &amp; D. The Wynne F. numbers may be found by multiplying the square root
  of the Watkins number by 6.4. Thus</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>&radic;250 = 15.81, and 15.81 × 6.4 = W.F. 101.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>For those photographers who are in the habit of using an actinometer
  giving the plate speeds in H. &amp; D. numbers, the following table,
  taken from the <i>Photographer's Daily Companion</i>, is given, <!-- Page
  106 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>{106}</span>which
  shows at a glance the relative speed numbers for the various systems. The
  Watkins and Wynne numbers only hold good, however, when the inertia has
  been found by the H. &amp; D. method.</p>

  <p>Although theoretically the higher the speed of the film the less the
  duration of exposure required, there is a practical limit, as besides the
  intensity and actinic value of the light admitted to the film a definite
  time is necessary for it to overcome the chemical inertia of the
  sensitised coating and produce a useful effect. With every make of film
  it is possible to give so short an exposure that although light does fall
  upon the film it does no work at all&mdash;in other words, we can say
  that for every film there is a minimum amount of light action, and
  anything below this is of no use. The exposure that enables the smallest
  amount of light action to take place is termed the limit of the smallest
  useful exposure. <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page107"></a>{107}</span></p>

  <p>There is also a maximum exposure in which the light affects
  practically all the silver in the film, and any increased light action
  has no increased effect. This is the limit of the greatest useful
  exposure.</p>

  <p>In photo-telegraphy the duration of exposure, as already pointed out,
  is determined by certain conditions connected with the transmitting
  apparatus, and with conditions similar to those mentioned on page 75 the
  length of exposure will vary roughly from 1-50th to 1-150th of a
  second.</p>

  <p>The most suitable film to use for purposes of photo-telegraphy is one
  having a fairly slow speed in which the range of exposure required comes
  well within the limits of the film. There is no advantage in using a film
  having a speed of, say, H. &amp; D. 300 if good results can be obtained
  from one with a speed of, say, H. &amp; D. 200, as the use of the higher
  speed increases the risk of overexposure. With the high-speeded films the
  difficulties of development are also greatly increased, there being more
  latitude in both exposure and development with the slower speeds, and
  consequently a better chance of obtaining a good negative.</p>

  <p>Another point, often puzzling to the beginner, and which increases the
  difficulty of choosing a suitable make of film, is that, although one
  make of film marked H. &amp; D. 100 will give good results, another make,
  also marked H. &amp; D. 100, will give <!-- Page 108 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>{108}</span>very poor results. This
  is owing, not to a poor quality film, as many suppose, but to the almost
  insurmountable difficulty of makers being able to employ exactly the same
  standard of light for testing purposes, so that although various makes
  may all be standardised by the H. &amp; D. method, films bearing the same
  speed numbers may vary in their actual speed by as much as 30 to 50 per
  cent.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX A</h3>

<p class="cenhead">SELENIUM CELLS</p>

  <p>Selenium is a non-metallic element, and was first discovered by
  Berzelius in 1817, in the deposit from sulphuric acid chambers, which
  still continues the source from which it is obtained for commercial
  purposes, although it is found to a small extent in native sulphur. Its
  at. wt. is 79.2, and its sp. gr. 4.8. Symbol, Se.</p>

  <p>In its natural state selenium is practically a non-conductor of
  electricity, its resistance being forty thousand million times greater
  than copper. Its practical value lies in the property which it possesses,
  that when in a prepared condition it is capable of varying its electrical
  resistance according to the amount of light to which it is exposed, the
  resistance decreasing as the light increases.</p>

  <p>Selenium is prepared by heating it to a temperature of 120° C.,
  keeping it there for some hours, and allowing it to cool slowly, when it
  assumes a crystalline form and changes from a bluish grey to a dull slate
  colour. A selenium cell in its simplest form consists merely of some
  prepared selenium placed between two or more metal electrodes, the
  selenium acting as a high resistance conductor between them. The form
  given by Bell and Tainter to the cells used in their experiments is given
  in Figs. 53 and 53<i>a</i>. It consists of a number of rectangular brass
  plates P, P', separated by very thin sheets of mica M, the mica sheets
  being slightly narrower than the brass plates, the whole being clamped
  together in the frame F by the two bolts B. <!-- Page 110 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>{110}</span>By means of a sand-bath
  the cell is raised to the desired temperature, and selenium is rubbed
  over the surface, which melts and fills the small spaces between the
  brass plates. All the plates P are connected together to form one
  terminal, and the plates P' to form the other. By using very thin mica
  sheets, and a large number of elements, a very narrow transverse section
  of selenium, together with a large active surface, can be obtained.</p>

  <p>The cell used for commercial purposes is usually constructed as
  follows. A small rectangular piece of porcelain, slate, mica, or other
  insulator, is wound with many turns of fine platinum wire. The wire is
  wound double, as shown in Fig. 54, the spaces between the turns being
  filled with prepared selenium. A thin glass cover is sometimes placed
  over the cell to protect the surface from injury.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 53<i>a</i>.
  </div>

  <p>A strong light falling upon a cell lowers its resistance, and <i>vice
  versa</i>, the resistance of a cell being at its highest when unexposed
  to light; the light is apparently absorbed and made to do work by varying
  the electrical resistance of the selenium. Selenium cells vary very
  considerably as regards their quality as well as in their electrical
  resistance, it being possible to obtain cells of the same size for any
  resistance between 10 and 1,000,000 ohms, and also, a cell may remain in
  good working condition for several months, while another will become
  useless in as many weeks.</p>

  <p>The ability of a cell to respond to very rapid changes in the
  illumination to which it is exposed is determined largely upon its
  inertia, it being taken as a general rule <!-- Page 111 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>{111}</span>that the higher the
  resistance of a cell the less the inertia, and <i>vice versa</i>, and
  also, that the higher the resistance the greater the ratio of
  sensitiveness. Inertia plays an important part in the working of a cell,
  slightly opposing the drop in resistance when illuminated, and opposing
  to a <span class="figleft" style="width:22%;"><a
  href="images/illo-fig54.png"><img style="width:100%"
  src="images/illo-fig54.png" alt="Fig. 54." title="Fig. 54." /></a><span
  class="sc">Fig.</span> 54</span> much greater degree the return to normal
  for no-illumination. The effects of inertia or "lag," as it is termed,
  can readily be seen by reference to Fig. 55. It will be noticed that the
  current value rapidly increases when the cell is first illuminated, but
  if after a short time <i>t</i> the light is cut off, the current value,
  instead of returning at once to normal for no-illumination, only
  partially rises owing to the interference of the inertia, and some time
  elapses before the cell returns to its normal condition; the time varying
  from a few seconds to several minutes, depending upon the characteristics
  of the cell and the amount of light to which it is exposed. An actual
  curve is given in Fig. 55<i>a</i>. The inertia or "lag" of a cell
  produces upon an intermittent current an effect similar to that produced
  by the capacity <span class="figright" style="width:17%;"><a
  href="images/illo-fig55.png"><img style="width:100%"
  src="images/illo-fig55.png" alt="Fig. 55." title="Fig. 55." /></a><span
  class="sc">Fig.</span> 55</span> of a line, as was noted in Chapter I.,
  preventing the incoming signals from being recorded separately, and
  distinctly. To obtain the best results in photo-telegraphy, the
  resistance of a cell should only be decreased to an extent sufficient to
  pass the current required to operate the recording apparatus, and the
  illumination should be regulated so that this condition of the cell takes
  place.</p>

  <p>The comparative slowness of selenium in responding to <!-- Page 112
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>{112}</span>any great
  changes in the illumination offers a serious difficulty to its use in
  photo-telegraphy, but various methods have been devised whereby the
  effects of inertia can be counteracted. In the system of De' Bernochi
  (see Chapter I.) the changes in the illumination are neither very rapid
  nor very great, and the inertia effects would therefore be very slight;
  but in any photo-telegraphic system in which a metal line print is used
  for transmitting, where the source of illumination is constant and the
  resistance of the cell is required to drop to a definite value and return
  to normal instantly, many times in succession, the inertia effects are
  very pronounced. The most successful method of counteracting the inertia
  is that adopted by Professor Korn of always keeping the cell sufficiently
  illuminated to overcome it, so that any additional light acts very
  rapidly. Another method worked out and patented by Professor Korn, and
  known as the "compensating cell" method, gives a practically dead beat
  action, the resistance returning to its normal condition as soon as the
  illumination ceases. The arrangement is given in the diagram Fig. 56.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:38%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 55<i>a</i>.
  </div>

  <p>Light from the transmitting or receiving apparatus, as the case may
  be, falls upon the selenium cell S<sup>1</sup>, which is <!-- Page 113
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"></a>{113}</span>placed on one
  arm of a Wheatstone bridge, a second cell S<sup>2</sup> being placed on
  the opposite arm. The selenium cell S<sup>1</sup> should have great
  sensitiveness and small inertia, the compensating cell S<sup>2</sup>
  having proportionally small sensitiveness and large inertia. Two
  batteries B, B', of about 100 volts, are connected as shown, B being
  provided with a compensating variable resistance W; W' is also a
  regulating resistance. When no light is falling upon the cell
  S<sup>1</sup>, light from L is prevented from reaching the second cell
  S<sup>2</sup> by a small shutter which is fastened to the strings of the
  Einthoven galvanometer (described in Chapter III.), and the piece of
  apparatus C&mdash;relay or galvanometer as the case may be&mdash;remains
  in a normal condition. When, however, light falls upon the cell
  S<sup>1</sup>, the balance of the bridge is upset, and light from L falls
  a fraction of a second later upon the second cell S<sup>2</sup>, and the
  current flowing through C completes the circuit. Needless to say it is
  necessary that the two cells be well matched, as it is very easy to have
  over-compensation, in which case the current is brought below zero.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:20%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig56.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig56.png"
      alt="Fig. 56." title="Fig. 56." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 56.
  </div>

  <p>It is also stated that by enclosing the cells in exhausted glass
  tubes, their inertia can be greatly reduced and their life considerably
  prolonged. The sensitiveness of a cell is the ratio between its
  resistance in the dark and its resistance when illuminated. The majority
  of cells have a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1, but Professor Korn has shown
  mathematically that by conforming to certain conditions regarding the
  construction the ratio of sensitiveness may be between 4:1 and 5:1. Thus
  a cell of R = 250,000 ohms can be reduced to 60,000 ohms from the light
  of a 16 c.p. lamp placed only a short distance away; the resistance may
  be still <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page114"></a>{114}</span>further decreased by continuing the
  illumination, but this produces a permanent defect in the cells termed
  "fatigue," the cells becoming very sluggish in their action and their
  sensitiveness gradually becoming less, the ratio between their resistance
  in the dark and their resistance when illuminated being reduced by as
  much as 30 per cent.</p>

  <p>Excessive illumination will also produce similar results. The inertia
  of a cell is practically unaffected by the wavelength of the light used,
  but the maximum sensitiveness of a cell is towards the yellow-orange
  portion of the spectrum.</p>

  <p>In addition to light, heat has also been found to vary the electrical
  resistance of selenium in a very remarkable manner. At 80° C. selenium is
  a non-conductor, but up to 210° C. the conductivity gradually increases,
  after which it again diminishes.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX B</h3>

<p class="cenhead">PREPARING THE METAL PRINTS</p>

  <p>Electricians who desire to experiment in photo-telegraphy, but who
  have no knowledge of photography, may perhaps find the following detailed
  description of preparing the metal prints of some value. The would-be
  experimenter may feel somewhat alarmed at the amount of work entailed,
  but once the various operations are thoroughly grasped, and with a little
  patience and practice, no very great difficulty should be experienced.
  The simpler photographic operations, such as developing, fixing, etc.,
  cannot be described here, and the beginner is advised to study a good
  text-book on the subject.</p>

  <p>The method to be given of preparing the photographs is practically the
  only one available for wireless transmission, and although the manner
  given of preparing is perhaps not strictly professional, having been
  modified in order to meet the requirements of the ordinary amateur
  experimenter, the results obtained will be found perfectly
  satisfactory.</p>

  <p>As will have been gathered from Chapter II., the camera used for
  copying has to have a single line screen placed a certain distance in
  front of the photographic plate, and the object of this screen is to
  break the image up into parallel bands, each band varying in width
  according to the density of the photograph from which it has been
  prepared. Thus a white portion of the photograph would consist of very
  narrow lines wide apart, while a dark portion would be made up of wide
  lines close together; a black part would appear solid and show no lines
  at all. It is, of course, obvious <!-- Page 116 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>{116}</span>that the lines on the
  negative cannot be wider apart, centre to centre, than the lines of the
  screen. A good screen distance has been found to be 1 to 64, <i>i.e.</i>
  the diameter of the stop is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>64</sub>th of the camera
  extension, and the distance of the screen lines from the photographic
  plate is 64 times the size of the screen opening. The following table
  shows what this distance is for the screen most likely to be used. The
  line screens used consist of glass plates upon which a number of lines
  are accurately ruled, the width of the lines and the spaces between being
  equal; the lines are filled in with an opaque substance. These ruled
  screens are very expensive, and are only made to order,<a name="NtA10"
  href="#Nt10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> a screen half-plate size costing from
  21s. to 27s. 6d. An efficient substitute for a ruled screen can be made
  by taking a rather large sheet of Bristol board and ruling lines across
  in pure black drawing ink, the width of the lines and the spaces between
  being <sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub>th of an inch respectively. A photograph
  must be taken of this card, the reduction in size determining the number
  of lines to the inch. A card 20 × 15 inches, with 12 lines to the inch,
  would, if reduced to 5 × 4 inches, make a screen having 48 lines to the
  inch. Preparing the board is rather a tedious operation, but the line
  negative produced will be found to give results almost as good as those
  obtained from a purchased screen.</p>

  <p>As it is impossible for many to have the use of professional apparatus
  designed for this particular kind of work, <!-- Page 117 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>{117}</span>the fixing of the
  screen into an ordinary camera must be left to the ingenuity of the
  worker. A half-plate back focussing camera will be found suitable for
  general experimental work, but if this is not available, a large box
  camera can be pressed into service.</p>

  <div class="figleft" style="width:24%;">

  <p>The writer has never seen a half-plate box camera, but one taking a 5
  × 4 inch plate can be obtained second-hand very cheaply. It is a
  comparatively simple matter to fix the line screen into a camera of this
  description, the drawings Figs. 57 and 58 showing the method adopted by
  the writer. The two clips D, made from fairly stout brass about
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch wide, are bent to the shape shown (an
  enlarged section is given at C) and soldered at the top and bottom of one
  of the metal sheaths provided for holding the plates. The distance
  between the front of the photographic plate (the film side) and the back
  of the line screen (also the film side), indicated by the arrow at A, is
  determined by the number of lines on the screen. As will be seen from the
  table given, the distance for a screen having 50 lines to the inch will
  be <sup>41</sup>/<sub>64</sub>ths of an inch.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:24%;">

  </div>

  <p>In all probability there will be enough clearance between the top of
  the sheath and the top of the camera to allow for the thickness of the
  clip, but if not, a shallow groove a little wider than the clip should be
  carefully cut in the top of the camera, so that it will slide in easily.
  The screen should be placed between the clips, the film side on the <!--
  Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page118"></a>{118}</span>inside, <i>i.e.</i> facing the
  photographic plate. As with a box camera the extension is a fixture, the
  size of stop to be used is a fixture also. The extension of a camera
  (this term really applies to a bellows camera) is measured from the front
  of the photographic plate to the diaphragm, and if this distance in our
  camera is 8 inches, then the diameter of the stop to give the best
  results would be <sup>1</sup>/<sub>64</sub>th of this, or
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>th inch. Although for all ordinary experimental
  work the lens fitted to the camera will be suitable, the best type of
  lens for process work of all kinds is the "Anastigmat."</p>

  <p>The picture or photograph from which it is desired to make a print
  should be fastened out perfectly flat upon a board with drawing pins, and
  if a copying stand is not available it must be placed upright in some
  convenient position. The diagram Fig. 59 gives the disposition of the
  apparatus required for copying. A simple and inexpensive copying stand is
  shown in Fig. 60. The blackboard A should be about 30 inches square, and
  must be fastened perfectly upright upon the base-board B. The stand C
  should be made so that it slides without any side play between the guides
  D, and should be of such a height that the lens of the camera comes
  exactly opposite the <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  style="width:32%;"><a href="images/illo-fig59.png"><img

  /></a><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 60.</span> centre of the board A. The
  camera, if of the box type, can be secured to the stand by means of a
  screw and wingnut, the screw being passed from the inside as shown. The
  beginner is advised to photograph only very bold and simple subjects,
  such as black and white drawings or enlargements. It is not safe to trust
  to the view-finders as to whether the whole of the picture is included on
  the plate, a piece of ground glass the same size as the plate sheaths,
  and used as a focussing screen, being much more reliable. It is a good
  plan to focus the camera for a number of different-sized pictures,
  marking the board A, and the <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page120"></a>{120}</span>guides D, so that adjustment is afterwards
  a very simple matter.</p>

  <p>The make of plate used is also a great factor in getting a good
  negative, and Wratten Process Plates will be found excellent. As already
  mentioned, such subjects as the exposure and the development of the plate
  cannot be dealt with here, these subjects having been exhaustively
  treated in several text-books on photography. With an arc lamp the
  exposure is about twice as long as in daylight, but the exposure varies
  with the amount of light admitted to the plate, character of the source
  of light, and the sensitiveness of the plate used, etc. The writer has
  used acetylene gas lamps for this purpose with great success. The
  beginner is advised to use artificial light, as this can be kept
  perfectly even. With daylight, however, the light is constantly
  fluctuating, and this renders the use of an actinometer a necessity for
  correct exposure. After development, if the plate is required for
  immediate use, it can be quickly dried by soaking for a few minutes in
  methylated spirit.</p>

  <p>Having obtained a good negative, the next operation is to prepare what
  is known as a metal print. For this we shall require some stout tin-foil
  or lead-foil, about 12 or 15 square feet to the pound, and this should be
  cut into pieces of such a size that it allows a lap of
  <sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub> inch when wrapped round the drum of the
  transmitting machine. Obtain some good fish-glue and add a saturated
  solution of bichromate of potash in the proportion of 4 parts of potash
  to 40 or 50 parts of glue. Pour a little of this glue into a shallow
  dish, lay a sheet of foil upon a flat board, and with a fairly stiff
  brush (a flat hog's-hair as wide as possible) proceed to coat the sheet
  of foil with a thin but perfectly even coating of glue. The thickness of
  the coating can only be found by trial, for if the coating is too thick a
  longer time will be required for printing; but it must not be thin enough
  to show interference colours. After the coating has been laid on, a soft
  brush, such as photographers use for dusting dry <!-- Page 121 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>{121}</span>plates, should be
  passed up and down, and across and across, with light, even strokes to
  remove any unevenness. A glue solution used by professional
  photo-engravers is as follows:</p>

<table class="nob" summary="Glue solution." title="Glue solution.">
<tr><td class="spacsingle"> Fish-glue </td><td class="spacsingle"> 12 oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle"> Bichromate of Ammonia </td><td class="spacsingle"> <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle"> Water </td><td class="spacsingle"> 18 to 24 oz.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="spacsingle"> Ammonia .880 </td><td class="spacsingle"> 30 minims.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>The bichromate should be dissolved in the water, and, when added to
  the glue, stir very thoroughly in order that complete mixing may take
  place. The coating may be done in a good light, not bright sunlight, but
  <i>it must be dried in the dark</i>, because, although insensitive while
  in a moist condition, it becomes sensitive immediately on desiccation. If
  allowed to dry in the light the whole coating will become insoluble, and
  for this reason the brushes used should be washed out as soon as they are
  finished with. The sheets will take about 15 minutes to dry in a
  perfectly dry room, but it is not advisable to prepare many sheets at
  once, as they will not keep for more than two or three days.</p>

  <p>The prepared negative must now be placed in an ordinary printing
  frame, and a print taken off upon one of the metal sheets in the same way
  as a print is taken off upon ordinary sensitised paper. In daylight the
  exposure varies from 5 to 20 minutes, but in artificial light various
  trials will have to be made in order to get the best results, the
  exposure varying with the amount of bichromate in the coating; the
  proportion of the bichromate to the glue should remain about 6 per cent.
  Light from a 25 ampere arc lamp for 2 to 5 minutes, at a distance of 18
  inches, will generally suffice to "print" the impression on the metal
  sheets. The printing finished, the metal print should be laid upon a
  sheet of glass and held under a running stream of water. The washing is
  complete as soon as the unexposed parts of the glue coating have been
  entirely washed away leaving the bare metal, and this will take anything
  from 3 to 7 <!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page122"></a>{122}</span>minutes, depending upon the thickness of
  the film. As soon as it is dry the print is ready for use.</p>

  <p>As already mentioned, the negative from which the metal print is made
  requires that the lines be perfectly sharp and opaque, and the spaces
  between perfectly transparent. Ordinary dry plates are too rapid, a
  rather slow plate being required. Wratten Process Plates give excellent
  results, and the following is a good developer to use with them:</p>

<table class="nob" summary="Developer." title="Developer.">
<tr><td class="spacsingle"> Glycin </td><td class="spacsingle"> &nbsp; &nbsp; 15 grammes </td><td class="spacsingle"> &nbsp; 1 oz.</td></tr>

</table>

  <p>This developer should be used for 6 minutes at a temperature of 50°
  F., 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> minutes at 65°, and
  1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> minutes at 80°. It is best only used once. If
  an intensifier is required, the following formula will be found to give
  satisfactory results:</p>

</table>

  <p>Allow to cool, completely pour off from any crystals, and add:</p>

<table class="nob" summary="Acid." title="Acid.">
<tr><td class="spacsingle"> Hydrochloric Acid </td><td class="spacsingle"> 30 minims </td><td class="spacsingle"> &nbsp; &nbsp; 4 c.c.</td></tr>
</table>

  <p>Allow negative to bleach thoroughly, wash well in water, and blacken
  in 10 per cent ammonia .880, or 5 per cent sodium sulphide.</p>

  <p>In preparing the negatives and metal prints the following points
  should be observed:</p>

  <p>A good negative should have the lines perfectly sharp and opaque;
  there should be no "fluff" between the lines even when they are close
  together.</p>

  <p>A properly exposed and developed negative should not require any
  reducing or intensifying.</p>

  <p>If the lamps used for illuminating the copying board are placed 2 feet
  away, and the exposure required is 5 minutes, the exposure, if the lamps
  are placed 4 feet away, will be <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page123"></a>{123}</span>20 minutes, as the amount of light which
  falls upon an object decreases as the inverse square of the distance.</p>

  <p>Get the coating on the foil as thin as possible, and err on the side
  of over-exposure, for if the coating is thick and has been under-exposed,
  excessive washing will dissolve the whole coating; for, unless
  insolubilisation has taken place right up to the metal base, the under
  parts will remain in a more or less soluble condition.</p>

  <p>On no account must the unexposed sheets be placed near a fire,
  otherwise they will be spoilt, the whole coating becoming insoluble; heat
  acting in the same manner as light.</p>

  <p>In washing, keep the print moving so that the stream of water does not
  fall continually in one place. It is best to hold the print so that the
  water runs off in the direction of the lines.</p>

  <p>To dry the prints after washing they can be laid out flat in a
  moderately warm oven, or before a stove, the heat of course not being
  sufficient to cause the coating to peel.</p>

  <p>To render the glue image more distinct the print should be immersed
  for a few seconds in an aniline dye solution, the glue taking up the
  colour readily. These dyes are soluble in either water or alcohol. A dye
  known as "magenta" is very good.</p>

  <p>The process of coating the metal sheets must be performed as quickly
  as possible (about 10 seconds), as owing to the peculiar nature of the
  bichromated glue it soon sets, and once this has taken place it is
  impossible to smooth down any unevenness.</p>

  <p>See that the negative and metal sheet make good contact while
  printing.</p>

  <p>If the glue solution does not adhere to the surface of the foil in a
  perfectly even film, but assumes a streaky appearance, a little liquid
  ammonia, or a weak solution of nitric acid, rubbed over the surface of
  the foil, which is afterwards gently scoured with precipitated chalk on a
  tuft of cotton <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page124"></a>{124}</span>wool, will remove the grease which is the
  cause of the difficulty.</p>

  <p>A photograph of a picture prepared from a line negative is given in
  Fig. 61. For a great many experiments, and in order to save time,
  trouble, and expense, sketches drawn upon stout lead-foil in an
  insulating ink will answer the purpose admirably, but if any exact work
  is to be done a single line print is of course absolutely necessary. The
  insulating ink can be prepared by dissolving shellac in methylated
  spirit, or ordinary gum can be used. A very fine brush should be used in
  place of a pen, as the gum will not flow freely from an ordinary nib
  unless greater pressure than the foil will safely stand be applied. A
  sketch prepared in this manner is shown in Fig. 62. A little aniline dye
  should be added to the gum to render it more visible, or a mixture of gum
  and liquid indian ink will be found suitable.</p>

  <p>With the copying arrangement already described it is only possible to
  employ it for reducing, it being necessary to employ a bellows camera
  with a back focussing attachment for purposes of enlarging, and this
  constitutes the chief drawback to the use of a fixed focus camera. By
  replacing the box camera with a focussing camera of the same size, we
  shall have a piece of apparatus capable of reducing or enlarging, only in
  this case the camera should be a fixture and the board, A, arranged to
  slide backwards and forwards instead.</p>

  <p>An extra improvement would be to rule the surface of the copying
  board, A, in a manner similar to that shown in the diagram, Fig. 63. The
  rulings should be marked off from the centre of the board, and should
  enclose parallelograms of the various plate sizes ranging from
  3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> × 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches up to the
  full size of the board. By fastening the picture or photograph to be
  copied in the space on the board corresponding in size, we can ensure
  that it is in the correct position for the whole to be included on the
  photographic plate, providing, of course, that the centre of lens and
  board coincide.</p>

  <p>With regard to the lens required, the practice adhered to by most
  photographers is to use a lens having a focal length equal to the
  diagonal of the plate used. Thus for a <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>-plate
  camera a 5-inch lens should be used, and for a
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-plate an 8-inch lens, and so on. For a 5 × 4
  inch camera a 6-inch lens will be required. The following is a simple
  rule for finding the conjugate foci of a lens, and is useful in obtaining
  the distance from the lens to the photographic plate and the picture to
  be copied. Let us suppose that we wish to make a
  1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> times enlarged line negative from a
  4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> × 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch print. Add 1
  to the number of times it is required to enlarge and multiply the result
  by the focal length of the lens in inches. In the present case this will
  be 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> + 1 = 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>; and if a
  6-inch lens is used, 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> × 6 = 15 inches will be
  the distance of the lens from the plate. Divide this number by the number
  of times it is desired to enlarge, and the distance of the lens from the
  picture to be copied is obtained; in this instance 15 ÷
  1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> = 10 inches. The same rule can be followed
  when it is required to reduce any given number of times, only in this
  case the greater number will represent the distance between the lens and
  the picture to be copied, and the lesser number the distance between the
  lens and the plate.</p>

  <p>In reducing, a <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>-plate lens will be found to
  fully cover a 5 × 4 inch plate, providing the reduction is not greater
  than three to one.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX C</h3>

<p class="cenhead">LENSES</p>

  <p>In this small volume it is not desirable, neither is it intended, to
  give an exhaustive treatment on the subject of lenses and their action,
  but as optics plays an important part in the transmission of photographs,
  both by wireless and over ordinary conductors, the following notes
  relating to a few necessary principles have been included as likely to
  prove of interest.</p>

  <p>Light always travels in straight lines when in a medium of uniform
  density, such as water, air, glass, etc., but on passing from one medium
  to another, such as from air to water, or air to glass, the direction of
  the light rays is changed, or, to use the correct term, <i>refracted</i>.
  This refraction of the rays of light only takes place when the incident
  rays are passed obliquely; if the incident rays are perpendicular to the
  surface separating the two media they are not refracted, but continue
  their course in a straight line.</p>

  <p>All liquid and solid bodies that are sufficiently transparent to allow
  light rays to pass through them possess the power of bending or
  refracting the rays, the degree of refraction, as already explained,
  depending upon the nature of the body.</p>

  <p>The law relating to refraction will perhaps be better understood by
  means of the following diagram. In Fig. 64 let the line AB represent the
  surface of a vessel of water. The line CD, which is perpendicular to the
  surface of the <!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page127"></a>{127}</span>water, is termed the <i>normal</i>, and a
  ray of light passed in this direction will continue in a straight line to
  the point E. If, however, the ray is passed in an oblique direction, such
  as ND, it will be seen that the ray is bent or refracted in the direction
  DM; if the ray of light is passed in any other oblique direction, such as
  JD, the refracted ray will be in the direction DK. The angle NDC is
  called the <i>angle of incidence</i> and MDE the <i>angle of
  refraction</i>. If we measure accurately the line NC, we shall find that
  it is 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, or more exactly 1.336, times greater
  than the line EM. If we repeat this measurement with the lines JH and PK
  we shall find that the line JH also bears the proportion of 1.336 to the
  line PK. The line NC is called the <i>sine of the angle of incidence</i>

  <p>Therefore in water the sine of the angle of incidence is to the sine
  of the angle of refraction as 1.336 is to 1, and this is true whatever
  the position of the incident ray with respect to the surface of the
  water. From this we say that <i>the sines of the angles of incidence and
  refraction have a constant proportion or ratio to one another</i>.</p>

  <p>The number 1.336 is termed the <i>refractive index</i>, or
  <i>coefficient</i>, or the <i>refractive power</i> of water. The
  refractive power varies, however, with other fluids and solids, and a
  complete table will be found in any good work on optics.</p>

  <p>Glass is the substance most commonly used for refracting the rays of
  light in optical work, the glass being worked up into different forms
  according to the purpose for which it <!-- Page 128 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>{128}</span>is intended. Solids
  formed in this way are termed <i>lenses</i>. A lens can be defined as a
  transparent medium which, owing to the curvature of its surfaces, is
  capable of converging or diverging the rays of light passed through it.
  According to its curvature it is either spherical, cylindrical,
  elliptical, or parabolic. The lenses used in optics are always
  exclusively spherical, the glass used in their construction being either
  crown glass, which is free from lead, or flint glass, which contains lead
  and is more refractive than crown glass. The refractive power of crown
  glass is from 1.534 to 1.525, and of flint glass from 1.625 to 1.590.
  Spherical surfaces in combination with each other or with plane surfaces
  give rise to six different forms of lenses, sections of which are given
  in Fig. 65.</p>

  <p>All lenses can be divided into two classes, convex or converging, or
  concave or diverging. In the figure, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>g</i> are
  converging lenses, being thicker at the middle than at the borders, and
  <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, which are thinner at the middle, being
  diverging lenses. The lenses <i>e</i> and <i>g</i> are also termed
  meniscus lenses, and <i>a</i> represents a prism. The line XY is the axis
  or <i>normal</i> of these lenses to which their plane surfaces are
  perpendicular.</p>

  <p>Let us first of all notice the action of a ray of light when passed
  through a prism. The prism, Fig. 66, is represented by the triangle BBB,
  and the incident ray by the line TA. <!-- Page 129 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>{129}</span>Where it enters the
  prism at A its direction is changed and it is bent or refracted towards
  the base of the prism, or towards the normal, this being always the case
  when light passes from a rare medium to a dense one, and where the light
  leaves the opposite face of the prism at D it is again refracted, but
  away from the normal in an opposite direction to the incident ray, since
  it is passing from a dense to a rare medium. The line DP is called the
  <i>emergent</i> or refracted ray. If the eye is placed at T, and a bright
  object at P, the object is seen not at P, but at the point H, since the
  eye cannot follow the course taken by the refracted rays. In other words,
  objects viewed through a prism always appear deflected towards its
  summit.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:38%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 66.
  </div>

  <p>In considering the action of a lens we can regard any lens as being
  built up of a number of prisms with curved faces in contact. Such a lens
  is shown in Fig. 67, the light rays being refracted towards the base of
  the prisms or towards the normal, as already explained; while the top
  half of the lens will refract all the light downwards, the bottom half
  will act as a series of inverted prisms and refract all the light
  upwards.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:31%;">

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 68.
  </div>

  <p>If a beam of parallel light&mdash;such as light from the sun&mdash;be
  passed through a double convex lens L, Fig. 68, we shall find that the
  rays have been refracted from their parallel course and brought together
  at a point F. This point F is <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page130"></a>{130}</span>termed the principal focus of the lens,
  and its distance from the lens is known as the focal length of that lens.
  In a double and equally convex lens of glass the focal length is equal to
  the radius of the spherical surfaces of the lens. If the lens is a
  plano-convex the focal length is twice the radius of its spherical
  surfaces. If the lens is unequally convex the focal length is found by
  the following rule: multiply the two radii of its surfaces and divide
  twice that product by the sum of the two radii, and the quotient will
  <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page131"></a>{131}</span>be the focal length required. Conversely,
  by placing a source of light at the point F the rays will be projected in
  a parallel beam the same diameter as the lens. If, however, instead of
  being parallel, the rays proceed from a point farther from the lens than
  the principal focus, as at A, Fig. 69, they are termed divergent rays,
  but they also will be brought to a focus at the other side of the lens at
  the point <i>a</i>. If the source of light A is moved nearer to the
  principal focus of the lens to a point A<sup>1</sup> the rays will come
  to a focus at the point <i>a</i><sup>1</sup>, and similarly when the
  light is at A<sup>2</sup> the rays will come to a focus at the point
  <i>a</i><sup>2</sup>. It can be found by direct experiment that the
  distance <i>fa</i> increases in the same proportion as AF diminishes, and
  diminishes in the same proportion as AF increases. The relationship which
  exists between pairs of points in this manner is termed the <i>conjugate
  foci</i> of a lens, and though every lens has only one principal focus,
  yet its conjugate foci are innumerable.</p>

  <p>The formation of an image of some distant object in its principal
  focus is one of the most useful properties of a convex lens, and it is
  this property that forms the basis of several well-known optical
  instruments, including the camera, telescope, microscope, etc.</p>

  <p>If we take an oblong wooden box, AA, and substitute a sheet of ground
  glass, C, for one end, and drill a small pinhole, H, in the centre of the
  other end opposite the <!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page132"></a>{132}</span>glass plate, we shall find that a
  tolerably good image of any object placed in front of the box will be
  formed upon the glass plate. The light rays from all points of the
  object, BD, Fig. 70, will pass straight through the hole H, and
  illuminate the ground glass screen at points immediately opposite them,
  forming a faint inverted image of the object BD. The purpose of the hole
  H is to prevent the rays from any one point of the object from falling
  upon any other point on the glass screen than the point immediately
  opposite to it, therefore the smaller we make H, the more distinct will
  be the image obtained. Reducing the size of H in order to produce a more
  distinct image has the effect of causing the image to become very faint,
  as the smaller the hole in H, the smaller the number of rays that can
  pass through from any point of the object. By enlarging the hole H
  gradually, the image will become more and more indistinct until such a
  size is reached that it disappears altogether.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:38%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig70.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig70.png"
      alt="Fig. 70." title="Fig. 70." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 70.
  </div>

  <p>If in this enlarged hole we place a double convex lens, LL, Fig. 71,
  whose focal length suits the length of the box, the image produced will
  be brighter and more distinct than that formed by the aperture, H, since
  the rays which proceed from any point of the object will be brought by
  the lens to a focus on the glass screen, forming a bright <!-- Page 133
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>{133}</span>distinct image
  of the point from which they come. The image owes its increased
  distinctness to the fact that the rays from any one point of the object
  cannot interfere with the rays from any other point, and its increased
  brightness to the great number of rays that are collected by the lens
  from each point of the object and focussed in the corresponding point of
  the image. It will be evident from a study of Fig. 71 that the image
  formed by a convex lens must necessarily be inverted, since it is
  impossible for the rays from the end, M, of the object to be carried by
  refraction to the upper end of the image at <i>n</i>. The relative
  positions of the object and image when placed at different distances from
  the lens are exactly the same as the conjugate foci of light rays as
  shown in Fig. 69.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:33%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig71.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig71.png"
      alt="Fig. 71." title="Fig. 71." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 71.
  </div>

  <p>The length of the image formed by a convex lens is to the length of
  the object as the distance of the image is to the distance of the object
  from the lens. For example, if a lens having a focal length of 12 inches
  is placed at a distance of 1000 feet from some object, then the size of
  the image will be to that of the object as 12 inches to 1000 feet, or
  1000 times smaller than the object; and if the length of the object is
  500 inches, then the length of the image will be the
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub>th part of 500 inches, or
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch. <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page134"></a>{134}</span></p>

  <p>The image formed by the convex lens in Fig. 71 is known as a <i>real
  image</i>, but in addition convex lenses possess the property of forming
  what are termed <i>virtual images</i>. The distinction can be expressed
  by saying, <i>real images are those formed by the refracted rays
  themselves, and virtual images those formed by their prolongations</i>.
  While a real image formed by a convex lens is always inverted and smaller
  than the object, the virtual image is always erect and larger than the
  object. The power possessed by convex lenses of forming virtual images is
  made use of in that useful but common piece of apparatus known as a
  reading or magnifying glass, by which objects placed within its focus are
  made larger or magnified when viewed through it; but in order to properly
  understand how objects seem to be brought nearer and apparently increased
  in size, we must first of all understand what is meant by the expression,
  <i>the apparent magnitude of objects</i>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:34%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig72.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig72.png"
      alt="Fig. 72." title="Fig. 72." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 72.
  </div>

  <p>The apparent magnitude of an object depends upon the angle which it
  subtends to the eye of the observer. The image at A, Fig. 72, presents a
  smaller angle to the eye than the angle presented by the object when
  moved to B, and the image therefore appears smaller. When the object is
  moved to either B or C, it is viewed under a much <!-- Page 135 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page135"></a>{135}</span>greater angle, causing
  the image to appear much larger. If we take a watch or other small
  circular object and place it at A, which we will suppose is a distance of
  50 yards, we shall find that it will be only visible as a circular
  object, and its apparent magnitude or the angle under which it is viewed
  is then stated to be very small. If the object is now moved to the point
  B, which is only 5 feet from the eye, its apparent magnitude will be
  found to have increased to such an extent that we can distinguish not
  only its shape, but also some of the marking. When moved to within a few
  inches from the eye as at C, we see it under an angle so great that all
  the detail can be distinctly seen. By having brought the object nearer
  the eye, thus rendering all its parts clearly visible, we have actually
  magnified it, or made it appear larger, although its actual size remains
  exactly the same. When the distance between the object and the observer
  is known, the apparent magnitude of the object varies inversely as the
  distance from the observer.</p>

  <p>Let us suppose that we wish to produce an image of a tree situated at
  a distance of 5000 feet. At this distance the light rays from the tree
  will be nearly parallel, so that if a lens having a focal length of 5
  feet is fastened in any convenient manner in the wall of a darkened room
  the image will be formed 5 feet behind the lens at its principal focus.
  If a screen of white cardboard be placed at this point we shall find that
  a small but inverted image of the tree will be focussed upon it. As the
  distance of the object is 5000 feet, and as the size of the received
  image is in proportion to this distance divided by the focal length of
  the lens, the image will be as 5000 ÷ 5, or 1000 times smaller than the
  object.</p>

  <p>If now the eye is placed six inches behind the screen and the screen
  removed, so that we can view the small image distinctly in the air, we
  shall see it with an apparent magnitude as much greater than if the same
  small image were equally far off with the tree, as 6 inches is to 5000
  <!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page136"></a>{136}</span>feet, that is 10,000 times. Thus we see
  that although the image produced on the screen is 1000 times less than
  the tree from one cause, yet on account of it being brought near to the
  eye it is 10,000 times greater in apparent magnitude; therefore its
  apparent magnitude is increased as 10,000 ÷ 1000, or 10 times. This means
  that by means of the lens it has actually been magnified 10 times. This
  magnifying power of a lens is always equal to the focal length divided by
  the distance at which we see small objects most distinctly, viz. 6
  inches, and in the present instance is 60 ÷ 6, or 10 times.</p>

  <p>When the image is received upon a screen the apparatus is called a
  <i>camera obscura</i>, but when the eye is used and sees the inverted
  image in the air, then the apparatus is termed a <i>telescope</i>.</p>

  <p>The image formed by a convex lens can be regarded as a new object, and
  if a second lens is placed behind it a second image will be formed in the
  same manner as if the first image were a real object. A succession of
  images can thus be formed by convex lenses, the last image being always
  treated as a fresh object, and being always an inverted image of the one
  before. From this it will be evident that additional magnifying power can
  be given to our telescope with one lens by bringing the image nearer the
  eye, and this is accomplished by placing a short focus lens between the
  image and the eye. By using a lens having a focal length of 1 inch, and
  such a lens will magnify 6 times, the total magnifying power of the two
  lenses will be 10 × 6 = 60 times, or 10 times by the first lens and 6
  times by the second. Such an instrument is known as a <i>compound or
  astronomical telescope</i>, and the first lens is called the object glass
  and the second lens the magnifying glass, or eye-piece.</p>

  <p>We are now in a position to understand how virtual images are formed,
  and the formation of a virtual image by means of a convex lens will be
  readily followed from a <!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page137"></a>{137}</span>study of Fig. 73. Let L represent a double
  convex lens, with an object, AB, placed between it and the point F, which
  is the principal focus of the lens. The rays from the object AB are
  refracted on passing through the lens, and again refracted on leaving the
  lens, so that an image of the object is formed at the eye, N. As it is
  impossible for the eye to follow the bent rays from the object, a virtual
  image is formed and is seen at A<sup>1</sup>B<sup>1</sup>, and is really
  a continuation of the emergent rays. The magnifying power of such a lens
  may be found by dividing 6 inches by the focal length of the lens, 6
  inches being the distance at which we see small objects most distinctly.
  A lens having a focal length of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch would
  magnify 24 times, and one with a focal length of
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub>th of an inch 600 times, and so on. The
  magnifying power is greater as the lens is more convex and the object
  near to the principal focus. When a single lens is applied in this manner
  it is termed a <i>single microscope</i>, but when more than one lens is
  employed in order to increase the magnifying power, as in the telescope,
  then the apparatus is termed a <i>compound microscope</i>.</p>

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 73.
  </div>

  <p>Unlike a convex lens, which can form both real and virtual images, a
  concave lens can only produce a virtual image; and while the convex lens
  forms an image larger <!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page138"></a>{138}</span>than the object, the concave lens forms an
  image smaller than the object. Let L, Fig. 74, represent a double concave
  lens, and AB the object. The rays from AB on passing through the lens are
  refracted, and they diverge in the direction RRRR, as if they proceeded
  from the point F, which is the principal focus of the lens, and the
  prolongations of these divergent rays produce a virtual image, erect and
  smaller than the object, at A<sup>1</sup>B<sup>1</sup>. The principal
  focal distance of concave lenses is found by exactly the same rule as
  that given for convex lenses.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:37%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig74.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig74.png"
      alt="Fig. 74." title="Fig. 74." /></a>
    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 74.
  </div>

  <p>Up to the present we have assumed that all the rays of light passed
  through a convex lens were brought to a focus at a point common to all
  the rays, but this is really only the case with a lens whose aperture
  does not exceed 12°. By aperture is meant the angle obtained by joining
  the edges of a lens with the principal focus. With lenses having a larger
  aperture the amount of refraction is greater at the edges than at the
  centre, and consequently the rays that pass through the edges of the lens
  are brought to a focus nearer the lens than the rays that pass through
  the centre. Since this defect arises from the spherical form of the lens
  it is termed <i>spherical aberration</i>, and in lenses that <!-- Page
  139 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>{139}</span>are used
  for photographic purposes the aberration has to be very carefully
  corrected.</p>

  <p>The distortion of an image formed by a convex lens is shown by the
  diagram, Fig. 75. If we receive the image upon a sheet of white cardboard
  placed at A, we shall find that while the outside edges will be clear and
  distinct, the inside will be blurred, the reverse being the case when the
  cardboard is moved to the point B.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:39%;">
      <a href="images/illo-fig75.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/illo-fig75.png"

    <span class="sc">Fig.</span> 77.
  </div>

  <p>Aberration is to a great extent minimised by giving to the lens a
  meniscus instead of a biconvex form, but as it is desirable to reduce the
  aberration to below once the <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page140"></a>{140}</span>thickness of the lens, and as this cannot
  be done by a single lens, we must have recourse to two lenses put
  together. The thickness of a lens is the difference between its thickness
  at the middle and at the circumference. In a double convex lens with
  equal convexities the aberration is 1<sup>67</sup>/<sub>100</sub>ths of
  its thickness. In a plano-convex lens with the plane side turned towards
  parallel rays the aberration is 4<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> times its
  thickness, but with the convex side turned towards parallel rays the
  aberration is only 1<sup>17</sup>/<sub>100</sub>ths of its thickness.</p>

  <p>By making use of two plano-convex lenses placed together as at Fig.
  76, the aberration will be one-fourth of that of a single lens, but the
  focal length of the lens, L<sup>1</sup>, must be half as much again as
  that of L. If their focal lengths are equal the aberration will only be a
  little more than half reduced. Spherical aberration, however, may be
  entirely destroyed by combining a meniscus and double convex lens, as
  shown in Fig. 77, the convex side being turned to the eye when used as a
  lens, and to parallel rays when used as a burning glass or condenser.</p>

<h3>Notes</h3>

<div class="note">
  <p><a name="Nt1" href="#NtA1">[1]</a> These measurements only apply to a
  single line. Where a double line is employed the capacity is halved.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt2" href="#NtA2">[2]</a> See Appendix A.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt3" href="#NtA3">[3]</a> See Appendix B.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt4" href="#NtA4">[4]</a> In wireless telegraphy "arcing" is
  principally caused by the continuation of the supply current in the
  spark-gap after the capacity has been charged to a potential sufficient
  to break down the insulation of the gap.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt5" href="#NtA5">[5]</a> See Chapter V.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt6" href="#NtA6">[6]</a> Nernst lamps are the best to use,
  as they produce abundantly the blue and violet rays which have the
  greatest chemical effect upon a photographic film. Carbon filament lamps
  are very poor in this respect.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt7" href="#NtA7">[7]</a> A description of the apparatus
  required will be found in Ganot's <i>Physics</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt8" href="#NtA8">[8]</a> Great care must be exercised in
  using this solution, as it is exceedingly poisonous.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt9" href="#NtA9">[9]</a> Two clocks would isochronise if
  their hands travelled at precisely the same rate round the dials, but
  would not synchronise unless they both registered the same time as
  well.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt10" href="#NtA10">[10]</a> Line screens can be obtained
  from Messrs. Penrose, 109 Farringdon Street, London; or Messrs.
  Fallowfield, 146 Charing Cross Road, London.</p>
